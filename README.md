# But what if i don't know how to add cards? :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card!

<b>Code -</b> 

                <!-- [character name] card start-->
                <div class="card mb-3 card-bg my-4" style="max-width: 100%;">
                  <div class="row no-gutters">
                     <div class="col-md-4">
                        <img src=[image-link] alt=[name of character] height="390px" width="300px">  
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-md-8">
                       <div class="card-body">
                          <h2 class="card-title">[name of character]</h2>
                          <p class="card-text">[Main description about character]</p>
                          <p>[some more description about character]</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <!--[character name] card end-->

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Try and test it on your own system and then create a Pull request. You can adjust height of image of character so that it will fit in card.
