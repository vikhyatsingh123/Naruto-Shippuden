                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                    <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra, which is much greater than
                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power unless they
                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                <p>He's worked and thrived at all levels, including among the ANBU. He has a summoning ability with a pack of Ninja Dogs,
                one of which speaks and all of which are excellent trackers. He's never been shown without his masks on. He wears at
                least two of them, and even his close friends don't know what he looks like.  
                Shortly after the ninja war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, after heading Obito's advice.</p>
