                            series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                            strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or
                            Leaf Village).</p>
                        <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra,
                            which is much greater than
                            the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                            Naruto his power unless they
                            were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his
                            name, Kurama. At this
                            point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death. </p>

Aside from that she's taken a journey that has completely changed her personality. In the beginning Ino was something of the Queen Bee in the School, very popular, pretty, and charismatic. She and Sakura were good friends right up until the time they started noticing Sasuke, and than they (like many other of the girls) started plotting to date him. Up until that point Ino was very encouraging to Sakura trying to break her out of her shell, but after that point focusing on sabotaging her. They both were quick to insult each other and belittle the abilities of the other. This conflict didn't come to outright blows however. At least not until the Chunin tournament.</p>

As per standard Root training, Sai was conditioned to remove all emotions and as such, had difficulty connecting with others. When he is added to Team Kakashi as a replacement for the rogue Sasuke Uchiha, Sai begins to learn more about people's feelings and tries to develop his personality and identity by forming genuine bonds and rediscovering the emotions he was taught to suppress.</p>
                        <p>Sai was orphaned as a child and recruited into Root, a secret branch of the Anbu under the leadership of Danzō Shimura. There, he was raised and conditioned to have no personality, personal connections, or a name; "Sai" being given to him for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi. Though largely successful in this regard, Sai retained an interest in art. When Shin, an older Root member, discovered Sai's drawing ability, he encouraged Sai's talent and they became very close.

                            Over time, Sai came to think of Shin as an older brother and looked up to him. Unfortunately, the final step in Root training called for the two to fight to the death to eradicate all remaining emotions. Before that happened, however, Shin died of an unnamed illness and Sai's Root training suppressed most of the memories he had of him.In the anime, Sai and Shin were forced to fight by Danzō but Shin, knowing that he was dying anyway, told Sai to report to Danzō that he had killed him in battle. Before dying, Shin told his brother that he had to suppress his feelings, and to live for the both of them.</p>

Afterward, Iruka is shelved, and we only see him once every year, as he occasionally pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>
           <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather.
He’s really only still around for nostalgic reasons-- as both readers and Naruto grow up with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than Iruka (i.e., Jiraiya, Kakashi).

In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.</p>

          <p>Although most people may judge him straight as evil but he was largely reposnible for the brief period of peace in konoha. He assasinated threats before anyone even noticed, extreminated rebillions even if it meant an entire clan.

She also appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>

              <p>Just as his father pulled pranks to have his existence acknowledged, Boruto commits mischief to get his father's attention after his rise to Hokage, such as defacing the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue. Boruto also admires his father's rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Yamato is introduced during Part II of the series as an ANBU member who becomes a substitute leader in Team Kakashi. "Yamato" is not his real name, rather a codename assigned for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi.</p>
          <p>Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as Tenzo, Yamato believes ninja should be able to look after themselves to the point of leaving behind any he sees as a hindrance. During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name Kinoe. After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Sanae is confident, energetic and dutiful, sometimes too much so, and tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She also appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> Shion was born to the priestess of the Land of Demons, Miroku, and inherited the gift of predicting the future; this gift was proven to be very accurate, which led many people to shun her in fear, leaving her isolated and lonely, with only her mother to comfort and accompany her. Under her mother's orders, Shion was not taught any ninjutsu by the guards, in the hopes she can live a normal life and not become a terrible threat should she be corrupted. Miroku also gave Shion a bell as a protective charm, which, unknown to Shion at the time, was imbued with tremendous powers to protect her when necessary. Shion ultimately saw her mother die when she sealed Mōryō away. Shion herself was then tasked to train in the method to seal away Mōryō again should the situation arise. </p>

                  <p>Kabuto proves himself a formidable opponent, having learned most of his skills under the tutelage of Orochimaru. He uses a lot of the same skills as his teacher, even leaning on snakes for support in a fight. It's Kabuto's ability to sniff out other people's insecurities and use them to his advantage in battle -- like Tsunade's fear of blood -- that makes him a particularly powerful Naruto character. When it comes to raw power, however, a lot of other characters have him beat.</p>

                    <p>More than anything, Kushina wanted to protect her newborn son Naruto. This was why she first objected to Minato's decision to seal the Nine-Tails into him. She did not want to impose the hardships that jinchūriki had to endure during their lives, and moreover did not want to leave her son an orphan should Minato carry out his plan which would also cost him his life and as such, Kushina wanted to sacrifice her own life and reseal the beast into herself. Ultimately agreeing to Minato's plan which would also protect their village, Kushina imparted her final words to Naruto by which he should live. </p>
