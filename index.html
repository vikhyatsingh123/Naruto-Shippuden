			Sumire was profoundly affected by the loss because one of her few delights was brushing her hair with her mother.
		        Over time, Sumire lost even the memory of her mother's voice.
			Tanuki Shigaraki, Sumire's father and a crazed Danzo devotee, raised her with the goal of exacting revenge on Root.

                                young creatures are cuter, smaller versions of their present-day selves, Chomei actually

                                He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with
                                the intention of beginning an era of peace.
                                When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the
                                village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death.
                                Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable
                                to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito
                                shortly before his actual death.
                                Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and
                                finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his

                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact,
                                she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders her bare

                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her forehead
                                to Creation Rebirth, a technique that releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the
                                cells in her body to heal any wound. It gives her a "immortality" in battle thateven

                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the

                                Kakashi and Sasuke were able to easily dispose of the Demon Brothers and keep Tazuna
                                alive. They were then tied up next to a tree and left to be arrested.

                                We never actually see the Demon Brothers being arrested in the manga and escaping from

                        making her seek for a daily peace. At a young age she was sent to Konoha and enrolled in the Academy.
                        Wanting to make a strong first impression, she proclaimed to her class that she would be the <b>first female Hokage.</b>
                        The other kids laughed at her statement, and began calling her "Tomato" because of her then-round face and fiery red hair.
                        Since Minato proved himself to be anything but, accepted her, and liked the one thing she hated about herself, 
                        Kushina fell in love with him, now considering her red hair as the "red thread of fate" (ÈÅãÂëΩ„ÅÆËµ§„ÅÑÁ≥∏, unmei no akai ito) 
                        that had brought them together. Ultimately, Minato's reciprocated feelings helped her with overcoming the Nine-Tails.</p>

                                joined the Akatsuki. There, he was partnered with Kakuzu,
                                despite the two's somewhat mutual dislike of each other.</p>
                            <p>Hidan doesn't always seem like the most intelligent of the Akatsuki. He certainly doesn't
                                have the knack for long-term planning that Pain or Tobi do,
                                for example. Hidan does, however, much like Kakuzu, have a great understanding of
                                anatomy and just how shinobi abilities work. That's how he
                                manages to keep himself functionally immortal. That gives him an edge in a fight even
                                when he isn't using his head for strategy.</p>

                            <p>The Third Raikage's rule was punctuated by the berserk attacks of the Eight-Tails but as

                                look for a suitable jinch≈´riki in quick succession, after the conclusion of each
                                rampage. During one of these attacks, he fought the Eight-Tails alone, allowing his

                                supported him during these occurrences. He chose to seal the Eight-Tails in the Kohaku

She was later recruited into Sasuke Uchiha's group Taka, which was initially called "Hebi" at the time of its creation.</p>
				<p>Karin has been praised for her abilities by both Obito Uchiha and Orochimaru, the latter deciding to take her with him for that reason. Despite being mostly a non-combatant, Orochimaru referred to Karin as one of his good experiments,[4] and had enough faith in her skills to put her in charge of the Southern Hideout's prison, since she made escaping impossible. Karin later demonstrated these skills most predominantly during the Fourth Shinobi World War, where she destroyed much of Tobi's giant wooden statue.</p>

                                done for Konohamaru his perspective changed drastically, and later the village during

                                Pain while rescuing Ebisu.

                             A's rule was punctuated by the berserk attacks of the Eight-Tails but as Kumogakure couldn't afford to dispose of such a valuable war deterrent, he was forced to look for a suitable jinch≈´riki in quick succession, after the conclusion of each rampage.
                             During one of these attacks, A fought the Eight-Tails alone, allowing his comrades to escape. Their battle resulted in A receiving a self-inflicted wound to the chest after he collapsed upon his own hand, which became his life's shame.
                             Since this event, he made it a personal duty to combat the Eight-Tails whenever its jinch≈´riki lost control, eventually making even his son become part of the group that supported him during these occurrences. 
                             He chose to seal the Eight-Tails in the Kohaku no J≈çhei, resulting in his nephew's death, hoping that someone else would have more success in controlling it.
                        A is a calm and seemingly level-headed person. He is also a man of honour as seen when he became outraged when M≈´ urges ≈ånoki to take advantage of the Allied Shinobi Forces after it is disbanded, telling him that he wouldn't allow the alliance to become destroyed. 
                            He is also a very proud and caring individual who will readily use himself as a shield or "go-between" to protect his comrades. This was also exemplified when it was revealed that after he received a scar from fighting the Eight-Tails, not even his son asked him about it in detail, out of his respect for his father's pride.
                            A was also a firm believer of children being destined to surpass their parents, so much so he told his fellow Kage who were reincarnated not to worry about being forced to fight against their fellow shinobi as their children would be able to defeat them.</p>
