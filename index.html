Guy did his best to embody his father's teachings, but had doubts that Duy's words were devoid of meaning.</p>

                                work tirelessly to achieve political stability and implement the institutions that made the village system work, thus ensuring Konoha's continuity and prosperity. After his brother's death, he would earn the title of Second
                                Hokage (二代目火影, Nidaime Hokage, literally meaning: Second Fire Shadow).</p>
                            <p>Like Hashirama before him, Tobirama tried to foster good relations with the other villages. He planned an alliance between Konoha and Kumogakure, but during a formal ceremony he and the Second Raikage were attacked by the Gold
                                and Silver Brothers and left near death. During the First Shinobi World War, Team Tobirama, as well as Danzō Shimura, Torifu Akimichi, and Kagami Uchiha found themselves surrounded by Kumo's Kinkaku Force. With no way for
                                all of them to escape, Tobirama volunteered to act as a decoy in place of Hiruzen. As he departed, he passed the title of Hokage to Hiruzen, before being killed by Kinkaku</p>

                            <p>The entire first chapter of Naruto focuses on Iruka and Naruto’s character arc, as he is the only person who bonds with Naruto on the first few chapters. Afterward, Iruka is shelved, and we only see him once every year, as
                                he occasionally pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>
                            <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather. He’s really only still around for nostalgic reasons--
                                as both readers and Naruto grow up with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than Iruka (i.e.,
                                Jiraiya, Kakashi).

                                and they became very close.

                                is a veteran samurai who couldn’t even come close to stopping Sasuke-- to the point that the five Kages had to intervene with their ninjutsu skills. The warriors, who are famed to outmatch ninjas, were defeated by one underage

                                chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort
                                to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.

                            become the nemesis of the series' lead character, Boruto Uzumaki. Kawaki is later introduced as a rebellious member from the organization Kara who wishes to escape and remove his cursed mark "Karma" (楔, Kāma) from his body.
                            In his escape he meets Boruto's ninja team, who take him to the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto takes the teenager under his wing, seeking to protect him from enemies, and he bonds with the family as time passes, beginning to view
                            Naruto as a father-figure and Boruto as a foster brother.</p>
                        <p>Kawaki's first appearance in the manga and anime of Boruto caused some backlash from the fanbase due to his implied violent actions against Naruto Uzumaki. However, his debut in the narrative proper was the subject of praise for
                            his interactions with the main character and his growth from a cold-hearted teenager to a more caring person under Naruto's influence.</p>

                            he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke

                            somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely

                            Boruto also admires his father's rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student.</p>

                            interests. During his Father's absence he became one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, a group who protected the Land of Fire's daimyo, indicated by the sash on his waist. Prior to returning to Konoha to resume active military
                            duty, he accumulated a bounty of 35 million ryō, something he seems to be particularly proud of.

                            was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name
                            Kinoe. After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.</p>

                            Miroku also gave Shion a bell as a protective charm, which, unknown to Shion at the time, was imbued with tremendous powers to protect her when necessary. Shion ultimately saw her mother die when she sealed Mōryō away. Shion
                            herself was then tasked to train in the method to seal away Mōryō again should the situation arise. </p>

                            on sight. Gaara would try to assure them he meant no harm, but in the process would inadvertently injure or even kill them with his sand. Gaara did not understand this pain he caused others because his sand protected him from
                            all injury. When he was six years old, Gaara asked Yashamaru to explain pain to him.</p>

                            praised highly for his clay sculptures, Deidara's desire to reach even greater heights in his art resulted with him stealing one of his village's kinjutsu that allows one to knead their chakra into substances.[1] Using explosive
                            clay to take out his pursuers, Deidara found the art he had desired: the Art of a Single Moment (一瞬の芸術, Isshun no Geijutsu).[1] Remembering the first moment whenever he detonated his explosive clay, he recalls the process that
                            allowed him to reach this art. Since then, Deidara became a missing-nin and offered his services as a bomber to insurgents in various countries.[1]

                        <p>More than anything, Kushina wanted to protect her newborn son Naruto. This was why she first objected to Minato's decision to seal the Nine-Tails into him. She did not want to impose the hardships that jinchūriki had to endure
                            during their lives, and moreover did not want to leave her son an orphan should Minato carry out his plan which would also cost him his life and as such, Kushina wanted to sacrifice her own life and reseal the beast into herself.
                            Ultimately agreeing to Minato's plan which would also protect their village, Kushina imparted her final words to Naruto by which he should live. </p>

Through having his nutrients absorbed from within his body, Isshiki began gaining control over Jigen's body, and eventually Jigen lost full control of it. Afterwards, Isshiki embedded his Kāma in Jigen, but because Jigen's body wasn't powerful enough to sustain him, Isshiki opted not to revive himself in Jigen, instead waiting until a more suitable vessel could be found.</p>
                  <p>As the leader of Kara, Jigen's body is modified with Scientific Ninja Tools, and is a complete monster in terms of power and ability. The strongest of his organisation, his might far surpasses even the other Inners. As the current vessel of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki, all his power comes from the exceedingly powerful Celestial Being who resides within his body</p>

Only Kawaki survived to become an actual vessel. Code on the other hand underwent shaking and spasms like the unsuccessful deceased candidates but managed to survive. Upon which, his branded mark become a White Kāma. Sometime after the Ōtsutsuki ritual, already deeply loyal to Isshiki, Code was so jealous to see only Kawaki proved viable as his next vessel that he came to openly hate Kawaki and even made it clear that if he weren't the vessel he would kill him with his own hands. Meanwhile, with the astounding reaction that took place in Code's body, his combat abilities exceeded Jigen's. While anyone in Kara who became stronger than Jigen through modifications would normally be disposed of to avoid undermining his position of leader, Code was exempted due to his unwavering loyalty, leading to Amado to instead install limiters in his body that only the scientist could deactivate</p>

                            Beast" (Konoha no Kedakai Aoi Mōjū; aka. "Konoha's Noble Green Beast"). Guy's favorite foods are super-spicy curry rice and curry udon, though he finds it impossible to dislike food. His favorite phrase is "Bursting with youth!"</p>
                        <p>Guy is on good terms with all of his students, though seems to have a particular interest in Lee, who reminds Guy of himself when he was younger, in that they were both considered to be losers and have had to earn everything through
                            hard work. As such, Guy puts much more interest in Lee's training than Neji's or Tenten's, continuing to train Lee long after the others have given up for the day. Because of this, and due to Lee's unyielding desire to master
                            the art of taijutsu, Guy has taught Lee a number of dangerous and forbidden techniques, giving the stipulation that Lee can only use them under specific circumstances. Although Guy knows of the dangers that teaching the techniques
                            to Lee entails, Guy wishes for Lee to be able to prove himself to be a splendid ninja, and as such turns a blind eye to the repercussions.</p>

            Jugo (重吾, Jūgo) is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.[ch. 414] After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation.[ch. 414] Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz and is also voiced by Kyle Hebert in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.
