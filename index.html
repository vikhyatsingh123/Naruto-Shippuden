                                series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha
                                (or
                                Leaf Village).</p>
                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                chakra,
                                which is much greater than
                                the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                                Naruto his power unless they
                                were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by
                                his
                                name, Kurama. At this
                                point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                                     to create a new world, free from the chaos of war.

                            He is a member of the Way of Jashin (ジャシン, lit. "evil god") religion which worships a deity of the same name and believes that anything less than

				    as the new leader of Ninshū, Black Zetsu tempted Hagoromo's elder son, Indra, to go in war with his younger brother. 
				    It decided that Indra's descendants, the Uchiha, would be the main cast of the shinobi history it 
				    was creating and also modified Hagoromo's tablet to claim that among other things; the Infinite Tsukuyomi would be the Uchiha's salvation.

                        <p class="card-text">Tobirama Senju (千手扉間, Senju Tobirama) was a member of the renowned Senju clan, 
                            who together with his elder brother and the Uchiha clan, founded the first shinobi village: Konohagakure.
                            Throughout his lifetime, Tobirama would work tirelessly to achieve political stability and implement the
                            institutions that made the village system work, thus ensuring Konoha's continuity and prosperity.
                            After his brother's death, he would earn the title of Second Hokage (二代目火影, Nidaime Hokage,
                            literally meaning: Second Fire Shadow).</p>
                        <p>Like Hashirama before him, Tobirama tried to foster good relations with the other villages. 
                            He planned an alliance between Konoha and Kumogakure, but during a formal ceremony he and 
                            the Second Raikage were attacked by the Gold and Silver Brothers and left near death.
                            During the First Shinobi World War, Team Tobirama, as well as Danzō Shimura, Torifu Akimichi, 
                            and Kagami Uchiha found themselves surrounded by Kumo's Kinkaku Force. 
                            With no way for all of them to escape, Tobirama volunteered to act as a decoy in place of Hiruzen.
                            As he departed, he passed the title of Hokage to Hiruzen, before being killed by Kinkaku</p>

                            Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own
                            plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to
                            Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his

Afterward, Iruka is shelved, and we only see him once every year, as he occasionally pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>
           <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather.
He’s really only still around for nostalgic reasons-- as both readers and Naruto grow up with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than Iruka (i.e., Jiraiya, Kakashi).

In the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort.

                                leaf village. Due to his powerful Sharingan Shisui was able to achieve every goal in his
                                mission.
                                Besides that Shisui was a good friend to Itachi Uchiha. Unfortunately his time didn't
                                lasted
                                longer,
                                Danzo Shimura (Head of Black Ops) wanted his Sharingan and Shisui never wanted to hand
                                his
                                eyes to a wrong
                                guy. He gave his eyes to his best friend who was like a younger brother to him and asked
                                him
                                to protect it.
                                He jumped off the cliff and then took his last breaths.

                            <p>Although Shisui Uchiha was not known much,but his will was strong.
                                He ended up giving his life for good deeds.People thought Itachi killed him because
                                of his greedines but the truth remained uncovered till the last chapters.

                                emotions and as such, had difficulty connecting with others. When he is added to Team
                                Kakashi as a replacement for the rogue Sasuke Uchiha, Sai begins to learn more about
                                people's feelings and tries to develop his personality and identity by forming genuine
                                bonds
                                and rediscovering the emotions he was taught to suppress.</p>

                                leadership of Danzō Shimura. There, he was raised and conditioned to have no

                                despised him. </p>
                            <p>The entire first chapter of Naruto focuses on Iruka and Naruto’s character arc, as he is
                                the only person who bonds with Naruto on the first few chapters.
                                Afterward, Iruka is shelved, and we only see him once every year, as he occasionally
                                pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>
                            <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make
                                us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather.
                                He’s really only still around for nostalgic reasons-- as both readers and Naruto grow up
                                with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to
                                meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than

                            <p class="card-text">The samurais are first introduced later in the Land of Iron. In order
                                to stop Sasuke and the Akatsuki, the five Kages decided to meet at the Summit hosted by
                                Mifune.</p>
                            <p> While ninjas focuse on chakaras and human bonds, the Samurais' chakaras focuse on
                                spirituality and the way of life.

                                The shinobi never meddled with the warriors because their Iado ability can outspeed a
                                ninja. Hence it made perfect sense to hold an alliance meeting in neutral territory
                                where samurais have the upper hand in terms of tactical advantage.

                                Yet, the warriors couldn’t stop Sasuke from intervening at the Summit. The moderator,
                                Mifune, is a veteran samurai who couldn’t even come close to stopping Sasuke-- to the
                                point that the five Kages had to intervene with their ninjutsu skills. The warriors, who
                                are famed to outmatch ninjas, were defeated by one underage boy.</p>

                                Kankuro, and is quite proficient in using a huge fan as her weapon for long range

                            </p>
                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In
                                the
                                first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against Ten-Ten
                                who
                                she easily defeats and continues to the final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru
                                tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while
                                but
                                in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra and
                                he
                                gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari
                                is
                                forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them,
                                Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little
                                effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.

                                only adult we first meet that cared for Naruto, while everyone else in the village
                                despised
                                him. </p>
                            <p>The entire first chapter of Naruto focuses on Iruka and Naruto’s character arc, as he is
                                the only person who bonds with Naruto on the first few chapters.
                                Afterward, Iruka is shelved, and we only see him once every year, as he occasionally
                                pops up
                                as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>
                            <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make
                                us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather.
                                He’s really only still around for nostalgic reasons-- as both readers and Naruto grow up
                                with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to
                                meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than
                                Iruka (i.e., Jiraiya, Kakashi).

                            <p class="card-text">A ninja from The Hidden Sand Village. She is the older sister of Gaara
                                and
                                Kankuro, and is quite proficient in using a huge fan as her weapon for long range
                                attacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In
                                the
                                first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against Ten-Ten
                                who
                                she easily defeats and continues to the final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru
                                tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while
                                but
                                in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra and
                                he
                                gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari
                                is
                                forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them,
                                Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little
                                effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.</p>

                                        so,
                                        and tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She
                                        also
                                        appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and
                                        having
                                        knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside
                                        World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in
                                        "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a
                                        complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as
                                        seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that
                                        she is
                                        adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>

                                        In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to

                                        appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and

                                        knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside
                                        World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in
                                        "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a
                                        complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as
                                        seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that

                                        adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text"> Shion was born to the priestess of the Land of Demons, Miroku,
                                        and
                                        inherited the gift of predicting the future; this gift was proven to be very
                                        accurate, which led many people to shun her in fear, leaving her isolated and
                                        lonely, with only her mother to comfort and accompany her. Under her mother's
                                        orders, Shion was not taught any ninjutsu by the guards, in the hopes she can
                                        live a
                                        normal life and not become a terrible threat should she be corrupted. Miroku
                                        also
                                        gave Shion a bell as a protective charm, which, unknown to Shion at the time,
                                        was
                                        imbued with tremendous powers to protect her when necessary. Shion ultimately
                                        saw
                                        her mother die when she sealed Mōryō away. Shion herself was then tasked to
                                        train in
                                        the method to seal away Mōryō again should the situation arise. </p>

                                    <p>Kabuto proves himself a formidable opponent, having learned most of his skills

                                        the tutelage of Orochimaru. He uses a lot of the same skills as his teacher,
                                        even
                                        leaning on snakes for support in a fight. It's Kabuto's ability to sniff out
                                        other
                                        people's insecurities and use them to his advantage in battle -- like Tsunade's
                                        fear
                                        of blood -- that makes him a particularly powerful Naruto character. When it
                                        comes
                                        to raw power, however, a lot of other characters have him beat.</p>

                                        she first objected to Minato's decision to seal the Nine-Tails into him. She did

                                        would also protect their village, Kushina imparted her final words to Naruto by

                                    Suna
                                    to fear him as a monster. With nobody to connect to, Gaara grew up hating the world
                                    and
                                    looking out only for himself, giving his life meaning by killing anyone he came

                                    cared for by his maternal uncle, Yashamaru. When he was allowed to roam around the
                                    village, Gaara would try to connect with the villagers, being kind to them and
                                    offering
                                    them any assistance he could. However, being a jinchūriki made the villagers

                                    of Gaara; adults avoided him and, when they couldn't, treated him delicately while
                                    children would run from him on sight. Gaara would try to assure them he meant no

                                    but in the process would inadvertently injure or even kill them with his sand. Gaara
                                    did
                                    not understand this pain he caused others because his sand protected him from all
                                    injury. When he was six years old, Gaara asked Yashamaru to explain pain to him.</p>

                                    genkai which he used as a member of the Explosion Corps.[4] Though praised highly

                                    resulted with him stealing one of his village's kinjutsu that allows one to knead
                                    their chakra into substances.[1] Using explosive clay to take out his pursuers,

                                    Geijutsu).[1] Remembering the first moment whenever he detonated his explosive clay,
                                    he recalls the process that allowed him to reach this art. Since then, Deidara
                                    became a missing-nin and offered his services as a bomber to insurgents in various

As a result, Hagoromo was born with the ability to manipulate the same type of powerful chakra as his mother. Angered by the fact that her chakra had been spread to others, Kaguya merged with the God Tree into the Ten-Tails, which attempted to reclaim her chakra.</p>

                    <p>Danzō Shimura (志村ダンゾウ, Shimura Danzō) was an elder of Konohagakure. As the founder and leader of Root, Danzō gained notoriety as The Darkness of the Shinobi (忍の闇, Shinobi no Yami, English TV: The Shinobi of Darkness)[3] because of his frequent unsanctioned actions and his often-suspected (but rarely proven) undermining of specific Konoha personnel. Despite his decades of suspicious deeds, Danzō only ever acted in what he believed were the village's best interests. He was appointed the Sixth Hokage Candidate (六代目火影候補, Rokudaime Hokage Kōho, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow Candidate) after Pain's assault on the village. Prior to being inaugurated officially into this post, Danzō would flee the Five Kage Summit and died in battle against Sasuke Uchiha at the Samurai Bridge.</p>

After developing a fixation on the Uchiha clan, more specifically Itachi, he took the Uchiha name for himself and severed ties with Orochimaru, taking his "sons" with him. Believing that peace was detrimental to human evolution, Shin began a plot to revive the Akatsuki so that the ensuing conflict would be a catalyst to further his beliefs.</p>
                  <p>Shin was a tall and fit man with a pale complexion and no hair, as well as a horizontal scar that ran from his right temple to the bridge of his nose. He also lacked any teeth, having used them all for his cloning experiments, and his right arm had been amputated above the elbow. His most striking features, however, were the numerous Sharingan implanted on his head and torso.</p>

A very tall mustached man with large poofy hair, curious way of dressing and with no eyebrows, he was laid back and very charismatic leader concerned with the welfare of his village.[ch. 546] He loathed the Second Tsuchikage and their final confrontation with each other resulted in their mutual deaths.[ch. 525] Gengetsu is brought back to life by Kabuto's resurrection technique to face the Shinobi Alliance in the Fourth Ninja War. Like other members of the Hozuki clan, he mastered hydrification technique, which manifests itself as an oily, water like substance.[ch. 548] He is voiced by Hideyuki Umezu in the Japanese anime, while Jamieson Price voices him in the English adaptation.
