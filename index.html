                                father was not an Uchiha.During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, her father died
                                while protecting her.From the grief brought on by his death, as well as feelings of
                                guilt that he would not have died had Izumi been stronger,Izumi eventually awakened her
                                Sharingan. She and her mother afterwards rejoined the Uchiha clan.</p>
                            <p>Izumi enrolled in Konoha's Academy a few years later.Like other girls her age, Izumi
                                developed a crush on Itachi Uchiha, a boy in the class next to hers.As such, she tried
                                to talk with him during school breaks, walk home with him after lessons, and defend him
                                from their peers' criticism. Itachi initially took the same disinterest in Izumi that he
                                had in all the other girls until discovering that she had the Sharingan, which he
                                himself had yet to awaken.He afterwards became warmer to her whenever their paths
                                crossed. </p>

                            <p>She would further speed up the process by giving her targets a choice between a French or
                                traditional kiss. Her most preferable victims were those with a natural affinity for
                                wind chakra. She took great pride in her appearance and would become infuriated when any
                                harm came to her physical being, especially her hair, the very casing of her soul.
                                During her second fight against Naruto Uzumaki, she showcased a sadistic side when she
                                delighted in Naruto's anguish. She has shown an intelligent side as seen when she
                                thought that Sora and Naruto were connected somehow.</p>

                                Monstrous physical
                                strength, extremely advanced healing and regenerative techniques, physician/surgeon
                                level of knowledge
                                of the human body and great Chakra control. At once formed part of "The Legendary
                                Sannin" along with
                                Jiraiya and Orochimaru, and under the tutelage of the Third Hokage. Currently, she
                                has become the Fifth
                                Hokage of The Hidden Leaf Village. Her grandparents are revealed to be Hashirama
                                Senju and Mito Uzumaki.</p>
                            <p>Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her
                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra
                                and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point
                                where she can break through boulders with
                                her bare hands. She is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds
                                that most others would consider impossible.
                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her
                                forehead to Creation Rebirth, a technique that
                                releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the cells in her body to heal any wound.
                                It gives her a "immortality" in battle that
                                even Orochimaru envied. However, because of the rapid cell regeneration, the
                                technique shortens her life similar to the Four-Tailed
                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the
                                technique, Tsunade has made the choice to only use
                                Creation Rebirth in extremely desperate situations.</p>

                                    <p>These were two former Hidden Mist shinobi, known as the Demon Brothers, who had defected from their village in order to join Zabuza's coup.

                                        Kakashi and Sasuke were able to easily dispose of the Demon Brothers and keep Tazuna alive. They were then tied up next to a tree and left to be arrested.
                                        
                                        We never actually see the Demon Brothers being arrested in the manga and escaping from being tied up is one of the most basic parts of ninja training. Were the Demon Brothers able to escape? If so, did they choose to abandon Zabuza? Why did they never reappear in the story afterward?</p>

Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.</p>

                                have the knack for long-term planning that Pain or Tobi do,
                                for example. Hidan does, however, much like Kakuzu, have a great understanding of
                                anatomy and just how shinobi abilities work. That's how he
                                manages to keep himself functionally immortal. That gives him an edge in a fight even

                                no Hanzō),
                                was a legendary shinobi, and the leader of Amegakure during his lifetime.
                            </p>
                            <p>At some point during Hanzō's childhood, he found a black salamander with deadly venom
                                residing in his village.
                                When it died, its venom sac was embedded into his body in the hopes of creating a
                                venomous ninja who himself was immune to toxins.
                                This required him to wear a mask constantly, in order to protect others from his
                                venom-laced breath.[4] At some point after this,
                                Hanzō became well known and renowned throughout the shinobi world, so much that enemies
                                have been known to flee at the very sight of him.

                                of the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death, she was partnered with Nagato, who had
                                since taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only member to call him
                                by his name. After Nagato's death, Konan defected from Akatsuki and became the de facto
                                village head of Amegakure.
                            </p>
                            <p>When she was young, Konan's family was killed during the Second Shinobi World War, and
                                she was left to fend for herself.[4] Some time later, Yahiko found her, and the two
                                worked together to survive. Not long after that, Konan
                                went for a walk and found a young, dying Nagato and his dog, Chibi. She rescued him and
                                brought him back to their hideout. Gradually the three became best friends. They
                                eventually encountered the Sannin, who gave them some
                                food. Konan impressed them by making an elaborate flower out of the paper wrappers left
                                behind as a sign of gratitude. When Orochimaru suggested to kill them so they would not
                                have to suffer the horrors of war, Jiraiya
                                instead opted to stay and teach the three how to look after themselves.</p>

                                specialises in training elite ninja. He also served as the leader of Team Ebisu, which

                            <p>Ebisu is portrayed as a stern and "by-the-book" type of person. Initially, he expressed
                                hatred for Naruto Uzumaki, and believed he was nothing but a worthless nuisance and
                                mocked his dream of becoming Hokage as he believes
                                that only people of high lineage could amount to anything. Upon seeing what Naruto had
                                done for Konohamaru his perspective changed drastically, and later the village during
                                Pain's assault on it, he chose not to surrender
                                Naruto's location and would rather be killed. He is also rather attached to his pupils,
                                and has shown immense pride in them, such as when Konohamaru performed the Rasengan on
                                Pain while rescuing Ebisu.

                                shinobi village: Konohagakure. Throughout his lifetime, Tobirama would

                                the village system work, thus ensuring Konoha's continuity and prosperity. After his

                                ceremony he and the Second Raikage were attacked by the Gold
                                and Silver Brothers and left near death. During the First Shinobi World War, Team

                                all of them to escape, Tobirama volunteered to act as a decoy in place of Hiruzen. As he
                                departed, he passed the title of Hokage to Hiruzen, before being killed by Kinkaku</p>

                                ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work
                                on his own plans. Unableto complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge

                                that she's taken a journey that has completely changed
                                her personality. In the beginning Ino was something of the Queen Bee in the School, very
                                popular, pretty, and charismatic. She and Sakura were good friends right up until the
                                time they started noticing Sasuke, and than
                                they (like many other of the girls) started plotting to date him. Up until that point
                                Ino was very encouraging to Sakura trying to break her out of her shell, but after that
                                point focusing on sabotaging her. They both were
                                quick to insult each other and belittle the abilities of the other. This conflict didn't
                                come to outright blows however. At least not until the Chunin tournament.</p>

                                her personality. In the beginning Ino was something of the Queen Bee in the School, very
                                popular, pretty, and charismatic. She and Sakura were good friends right up until the
                                time they started noticing Sasuke, and than
                                they (like many other of the girls) started plotting to date him. Up until that point
                                Ino was very encouraging to Sakura trying to break her out of her shell, but after that
                                point focusing on sabotaging her. They both were
                                quick to insult each other and belittle the abilities of the other. This conflict didn't
                                come to outright blows however. At least not until the Chunin tournament.</p>

                                despised him. </p>
                            <p>The entire first chapter of Naruto focuses on Iruka and Naruto’s character arc, as he is
                                the only person who bonds with Naruto on the first few chapters. Afterward, Iruka is
                                shelved, and we only see him once every year, as
                                he occasionally pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty
                                useless.</p>
                            <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make
                                us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather. He’s
                                really only still around for nostalgic reasons--
                                as both readers and Naruto grow up with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much
                                to the plot. Naruto goes on to meet other mentors and figures that have a much more
                                significant impression on him than Iruka (i.e.,
                                Jiraiya, Kakashi).

                            <p class="card-text">A ninja from The Hidden Sand Village. She is the older sister of Gaara
                                and Kankuro, and is quite proficient in using a huge fan as her weapon for long range
                                attacks.</p>
                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In
                                the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against
                                Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the
                                final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow
                                possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind
                                outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of
                                chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha
                                begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke
                                begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort
                                to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated,
                                Temari and Kankuro carry him home.</p>

                                to him and asked him to protect it. He jumped off the cliff and then took his last

                            <p>Kakuzu is a member/Accountant of Akatsuki and partner of Hidan , Kakuzu is from
                                Takigakure, the Village Hidden in a Waterfall. Kakuzu is a very powerful shinobi, he
                                posses five hearts which allow him to posses five lives. Kakuzu
                                is able to replace these hearts if they are destroyed by removing them from a defeated
                                opponent. Kakuzu is also able to use his hearts as weapons, the heart can be released
                                from his body and take control of the string and
                                build a body to use to fight with. Each one of his hearts has a different chakra
                                element. Kakuzu has some very strange techniques, the weirdest of them all is that his
                                body is made up of a string that can expand across
                                a long distance by his chakra. Another technique is that he is able to shield his body
                                from any attack if he is able too.</p>

                                to this, he was a Root member. As per standard Root training, Sai was conditioned to
                                remove all emotions and as such, had difficulty connecting with others.
                                When he is added to Team Kakashi as a replacement for the rogue Sasuke Uchiha, Sai
                                begins to learn more about people's feelings and tries to develop his personality and
                                identity by forming genuine bonds and rediscovering
                                the emotions he was taught to suppress.</p>
                            <p>Sai was orphaned as a child and recruited into Root, a secret branch of the Anbu under
                                the leadership of Danzō Shimura. There, he was raised and conditioned to have no
                                personality, personal connections, or a name; "Sai" being
                                given to him for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi. Though largely successful in this
                                regard, Sai retained an interest in art. When Shin, an older Root member, discovered
                                Sai's drawing ability, he encouraged Sai's talent
                                and they became very close.

                                begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke
                                begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort
                                to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated,
                                Temari and Kankuro carry him home.</p>

                            <p> While ninjas focuse on chakaras and human bonds, the Samurais' chakaras focuse on
                                spirituality and the way of life. The shinobi never meddled with the warriors because
                                their Iado ability can outspeed a ninja. Hence it made
                                perfect sense to hold an alliance meeting in neutral territory where samurais have the
                                upper hand in terms of tactical advantage. Yet, the warriors couldn’t stop Sasuke from
                                intervening at the Summit. The moderator, Mifune,
                                is a veteran samurai who couldn’t even come close to stopping Sasuke-- to the point that
                                the five Kages had to intervene with their ninjutsu skills. The warriors, who are famed
                                to outmatch ninjas, were defeated by one underage

                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In
                                the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against
                                Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the
                                final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow
                                possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind
                                outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of
                                chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha
                                begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke
                                begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort
                                to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated,
                                Temari and Kankuro carry him home.

                                become the nemesis of the series' lead character, Boruto Uzumaki. Kawaki is later
                                introduced as a rebellious member from the organization Kara who wishes to escape and

                                tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She also appears
                                to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having
                                knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World,
                                much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in "exterminating"
                                youkai and solving incidents. She also may have
                                somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take
                                her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she
                                is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely
                                rare case.</p>

                                Silence and used the Fourth Great Shinobi War to build his power, using his genjutsu to
                                capture high level ninja. Considered one of the greatest genjutsu users to ever live,

                                somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take
                                her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she
                                is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely
                                rare case.</p>

                                inherited the gift of predicting the future; this gift was proven to be very accurate,
                                which led many people to shun her in fear, leaving her isolated and lonely,
                                with only her mother to comfort and accompany her. Under her mother's orders, Shion was
                                not taught any ninjutsu by the guards, in the hopes she can live a normal life and not
                                become a terrible threat should she be corrupted.
                                Miroku also gave Shion a bell as a protective charm, which, unknown to Shion at the
                                time, was imbued with tremendous powers to protect her when necessary. Shion ultimately
                                saw her mother die when she sealed Mōryō away. Shion
                                herself was then tasked to train in the method to seal away Mōryō again should the
                                situation arise. </p>

                                jinchūriki of the One-Tailed Shukaku before he was born, causing the villagers of Suna
                                to fear him as a monster. With nobody to connect to, Gaara grew up hating the
                                world and looking out only for himself, giving his life meaning by killing anyone he
                                came across

                            <p>Gaara was raised in isolation during his early life, taught ninjutsu by his father and
                                cared for by his maternal uncle, Yashamaru. When he was allowed to roam around the
                                village, Gaara would try to connect with the villagers, being
                                kind to them and offering them any assistance he could. However, being a jinchūriki made
                                the villagers frightened of Gaara; adults avoided him and, when they couldn't, treated
                                him delicately while children would run from him
                                on sight. Gaara would try to assure them he meant no harm, but in the process would
                                inadvertently injure or even kill them with his sand. Gaara did not understand this pain
                                he caused others because his sand protected him from
                                all injury. When he was six years old, Gaara asked Yashamaru to explain pain to him.</p>

                                familiarised with his fighting style.[3] He possessed the Explosion Release kekkei
                                genkai which he used as a member of the Explosion Corps.[4] Though
                                praised highly for his clay sculptures, Deidara's desire to reach even greater heights
                                in his art resulted with him stealing one of his village's kinjutsu that allows one to
                                knead their chakra into substances.[1] Using explosive
                                clay to take out his pursuers, Deidara found the art he had desired: the Art of a Single
                                Moment (一瞬の芸術, Isshun no Geijutsu).[1] Remembering the first moment whenever he
                                detonated his explosive clay, he recalls the process that
                                allowed him to reach this art. Since then, Deidara became a missing-nin and offered his
                                services as a bomber to insurgents in various countries.[1]

                            <p>Shikadai is the only child of Shikamaru and Temari Nara. Shortly after his birth,

                                off exploring the world with his friends. Being acquainted
                                with Mirai Sarutobi since his birth, the two developed a sibling-like relationship
                                during their training under his father. He would also regularly be practiced on by her
                                for her genjutsu. As his parents continued to stay close
                                to their childhood friends over the years, Shikadai ultimately came to know the various
                                parents' respective kids well, but grew especially close to Boruto Uzumaki. On the day

                                ancestor of shinobi,[4] for his act of founding ninshū which led to the creation of the
                                ninja world. He was the son of Princess Kaguya‎‎ and alongside his fraternal twin
                                brother, Hamura, were the first to be born with the same
                                powerful chakra as their mother. Together, he and his brother defeated their mother, who
                                had become the terrifying Ten-Tails, in battle and sealed the powerful beast within

                                was born with the ability to manipulate the same type of powerful chakra as his mother.

                                to others, Kaguya merged with the God Tree into the Ten-Tails, which attempted to

                            <p>More than anything, Kushina wanted to protect her newborn son Naruto. This was why she
                                first objected to Minato's decision to seal the Nine-Tails into him. She did not want to
                                impose the hardships that jinchūriki had to endure
                                during their lives, and moreover did not want to leave her son an orphan should Minato
                                carry out his plan which would also cost him his life and as such, Kushina wanted to
                                sacrifice her own life and reseal the beast into herself.
                                Ultimately agreeing to Minato's plan which would also protect their village, Kushina
                                imparted her final words to Naruto by which he should live. </p>

                                Earth, Jigen was a novice monk and after Kaguya left him for dead, Isshiki assaulted
                                Jigen, during which he shrunk himself and entered the monk's ear in order to survive.
                                Through having his nutrients absorbed from within his body, Isshiki began gaining
                                control over Jigen's body, and eventually Jigen lost full control of it. Afterwards,
                                Isshiki embedded his Kāma in Jigen, but because Jigen's body wasn't powerful enough to
                                sustain him, Isshiki opted not to revive himself in Jigen, instead waiting until a more
                                suitable vessel could be found.</p>
                            <p>As the leader of Kara, Jigen's body is modified with Scientific Ninja Tools, and is a
                                complete monster in terms of power and ability. The strongest of his organisation, his
                                might far surpasses even the other Inners. As the current vessel of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki,
                                all his power comes from the exceedingly powerful Celestial Being who resides within his

                                in Jigen and Amado's Ōtsutsuki ritual to screen for a Kāma vessel for Isshiki. Only
                                Kawaki survived to become an actual vessel. Code on the other hand underwent shaking and
                                spasms like the unsuccessful deceased candidates but managed to survive. Upon which, his
                                branded mark become a White Kāma. Sometime after the Ōtsutsuki ritual, already deeply
                                loyal to Isshiki, Code was so jealous to see only Kawaki proved viable as his next
                                vessel that he came to openly hate Kawaki and even made it clear that if he weren't the
                                vessel he would kill him with his own hands. Meanwhile, with the astounding reaction
                                that took place in Code's body, his combat abilities exceeded Jigen's. While anyone in
                                Kara who became stronger than Jigen through modifications would normally be disposed of
                                to avoid undermining his position of leader, Code was exempted due to his unwavering
                                loyalty, leading to Amado to instead install limiters in his body that only the
                                scientist could deactivate</p>

                                the protagonists. During the Sasuke Retrieval Arc Choji fought Jiroubou alone. He forced

                            <p class="card-text">Might Guy is the extremely zealous leader of Team Guy, consisting of
                                Rock Lee, Neji Hyuga, and Tenten. Known for his thick eyebrows, green jumpsuit, and
                                shiny bowl haircut, Guy often refers to himself as "Konoha's Prideful Green
                                Beast" (Konoha no Kedakai Aoi Mōjū; aka. "Konoha's Noble Green Beast"). Guy's favorite
                                foods are super-spicy curry rice and curry udon, though he finds it impossible to
                                dislike food. His favorite phrase is "Bursting with youth!"</p>
                            <p>Guy is on good terms with all of his students, though seems to have a particular interest
                                in Lee, who reminds Guy of himself when he was younger, in that they were both
                                considered to be losers and have had to earn everything through
                                hard work. As such, Guy puts much more interest in Lee's training than Neji's or
                                Tenten's, continuing to train Lee long after the others have given up for the day.
                                Because of this, and due to Lee's unyielding desire to master
                                the art of taijutsu, Guy has taught Lee a number of dangerous and forbidden techniques,
                                giving the stipulation that Lee can only use them under specific circumstances. Although
                                Guy knows of the dangers that teaching the techniques
                                to Lee entails, Guy wishes for Lee to be able to prove himself to be a splendid ninja,
                                and as such turns a blind eye to the repercussions.</p>

                                Path. After Madara Uchiha summoned the statue and cultivated Hashirama Senju's DNA into
                                a large flowering tree, Black Zetsu removed White Zetsu and the other victims from
                                inside the husk, leading Madara to believe they were
                                artificial humans created by the statue's chakra and Hashirama's DNA.</p>
                            <p>White Zetsu and other mutated humans were then tasked with intelligence gathering before

                                Obito Uchiha. Over time, the duo became friends with

                                Tajima was a calm and stoic individual. He also seemed to have great confidence in his
                                son, Madara, respecting his decision to retreat from a confrontation with the Senju
                                after Madara noted that the odds were probably against them with Hashirama present.

                                Jugo (重吾, Jūgo) is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu,
                                but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of
                                extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike
                                form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast,
                                eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.[ch. 414] After
                                meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke
                                managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo
                                decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation.[ch. 414]
                                Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English
                                dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz and is
                                also voiced by Kyle Hebert in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.

                            <p class="card-text">Fukasaku, like his wife Shima, is considered very wise and is greatly
                                respected by all who know them well enough. In reality, he constantly bickers with Shima
                                over small things when they should focus on the bigger picture, such as the fact that a
                                battle will cause them to miss dinner.They are still close, as Shima is heartbroken
                                after Fukasaku is killed by Pain. Though Fukasaku remains serious in even the worst
                                situation, he and his wife will constantly find a reason to bicker with each other. He
                                also has a tendency to call the Great Toad Sage, "senile" for constantly forgetting
                                everything.</p>
                            <p>Fukasaku and Shima both seem fond of Naruto. Fukasaku met Naruto for the first time when
                                he brought the news of Jiraiya's death to Konoha. He found Naruto's nickname for Jiraiya
                                ("Pervy Sage") to be both very fitting and very funny, but observed that Naruto, as he
                                was, would not stand a chance against Pain, and offered to take Naruto away to learn
                                senjutsu at Mount Myōboku. After what was (for Naruto) a confusing introduction to
                                sensing natural energy and drawing it in to blend senjutsu chakra, Fukasaku, in light of
                                Naruto's rapid progress, believed that Naruto would surpass Jiraiya in power.</p>

                                even by the Hyūga's standards, Neji was a member of the clan's branch house; no matter

                                that convinced him fate was predetermined.</p>
                            <p> After experiencing Naruto Uzumaki's refusal to be limited by such an ideology, Neji
                                realised his fate was what he chose it to be, and as a member of Team Guy he sought the

                                ultimately sacrificed his life to protect the very same person who taught him about the

                                during the war-torn era preceding the era of hidden villages.</p>
                            <p> Butsuma appeared to be a stoic and calm man but was also quite stern and somewhat
                                belligerent. He lost his temper and even went as far as to hit his son Hashirama when
                                the latter brought up the subject of using innocent children as shinobi, believing that
                                they had died true shinobi and would not stand for his son besmirching that memory. He
                                believed that raising your children to be the best shinobi they can was the greatest
                                love a parent could show for their child. He and Tajima, were also very alike as a
                                result of their continuous battles, both in skill, and mindset, which was why they
                                presumably ended in stalemate with every confrontation. They even shared no hesitation
                                in killing each other's respective offspring just to create an opening to attack each
                                other. Despite the time he lived in making him seem like a harsh parent, he nonetheless
                                did love his sons dearly. After learning Hashirama often went out to hang out with a
                                member of the Uchiha Clan, he kept it a secret from the rest of the clan to prevent
                                Hashirama from being branded a traitor. He was also angry when Hashirama did what he
                                perceived as "disrespecting" Kawarama and punched him, but when Tobirama pointed out
                                Hashirama was depressed, he stopped from attacking Hashirama any further, telling him to
                                cool off.</p>

                                of Naruto; Naruto loved ramen and Ichiraku loved preparing it for him. Since ramen has
                                been the extent of their relationship all these years, Ichiraku was surprised to be
                                invited to Naruto's wedding.</p>
                            <p> He decides that giving Naruto free ramen for a year would be the most appropriate
                                wedding gift. Ichiraku then realises how much ramen Naruto can eat, and starts
                                decreasing the duration of the offer, but every span of time he considers leaves him
                                with visions of Ichiraku Ramen going bankrupt and his daughter being put out on the
                                street. He also has visions of Naruto's smiling face whenever he finishes a bowl of his
                                ramen. Ichiraku settles on giving Naruto free and unlimited ramen for the rest of his
                                life.</p>

                            <p>Fūka was portrayed as a seductive vixen as a way to lure her prey in and kill them with
                                an Execution by Kiss. She would further speed up the process by giving her targets a
                                choice between a French or traditional kiss. Her most preferable victims were those with
                                a natural affinity for wind chakra. She took great pride in her appearance and would
                                become infuriated when any harm came to her physical being, especially her hair, the
                                very casing of her soul. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">Kurenai Yuhi is the leader of Team 8, a skilled user of genjutsu,
                                particularly skilled with illusions involving plants. Of all her students, Kurenai is
                                closest with Hinata, acting as a surrogate parent in the absence of Hinata's
                                father, and helping Hinata overcome her weaknesses. Whenever Kurenai appears in the
                                series, she is usually accompanied by her childhood friend Asuma Sarutobi, and during
                                Part II of the series, Kurenai is revealed to be pregnant
                                with Asuma's child. Several months after Asuma's death, Kurenai gave birth to their
                                daughter Mirai Sarutobi, who later becomes a kunoichi by the events of the series
                                epilogue.</p>
                            <p>For the most part, Konoha's most notable jonins have been through many memorable
                                life-or-death battles. Kakashi has clashed with the likes of Zabuza and Obito, Guy
                                nearly defeated Madara by opening all Eight Gates, and Asuma had one of the saddest
                                deaths as a result of his intense battle with Hidan. The only jonin teacher who failed
                                to have at least one memorable battle is Kurenai.

                                Even in her brief encounter with Itachi, Kurenai's most redeeming factor, her genjutsu,
                                proved to be useless against the Uchiha's Mangekyo Sharingan. Even since that one
                                underwhelming exchange, Kurenai became pregnant and disappeared from the battlefield for
                                the rest of the series.</p>

                                powerful the other elders in the village are.
                                When the truth about Itachi's past was discovered, it was revealed that the Third Hokage
                                opposed the plan to wipe out the Uchiha clan, but the three village elders (Danzo,
                                Homura, and Koharu) had the ability to outvote him and sanction the massacre of hundreds
                                of villagers.
                                It seemed as it Homura and Koharu were being planned for something big, as they were
                                always opposing Tsunade's rule and deemed Naruto to be a threat.
                                Sasuke also had plans to kill the two of them, as they were involved in the destruction
                                of his clan. None of these plots came to pass and they are last seen planning for the

                            <p>Darui was once a student of the Third Raikage. During his training, Darui learned, among
                                other things, the Raikage's unique black lightning technique. Along with C, he also
                                served as the Third Raikage's support.

                                In the anime, when Konohagakure and Sunagakure invited other villages to an unscheduled
                                joint Chūnin Exams, the Fourth Raikage was furious at this, taking it as an underhanded
                                scheme to attack Kumogakure. While A flatly told his men to reject Tsunade's offer,
                                Darui informed A that he already informed Killer B of this. A quickly instructed Darui

                                intelligence-gathering and medicine attracted the attention of Orochimaru when he was

                                thereafter seeks power and becomes a major factor in the Fourth Shinobi World War, using
                                his higher place in the world so that he can find where in it he belongs. After finally
                                finding himself in the world, Kabuto returns to Konohagakure to run the orphanage there,

                                Boruto Uzumaki was his "sun", he became a shinobi and was placed on Team Konohamaru.</p>
                            <p>Using cloning technology, Mitsuki was created as a clone of Orochimaru, being cultivated
                                from the same embryo as at least one older "Mitsuki", and raised in a test tube. Just
                                like his "brother", Mitsuki was named after "Tsuki" (坏 , literally meaning: Shallow
                                bowl) and the sixth sign of the Chinese zodiac calendar, "Mi" (巳, literally meaning:
                                Snake). In the event someone was to learn what Mitsuki was, Orochimaru implanted a
                                strong juinjutsu on his heart,that would automatically activate, causing Mitsuki to self
                                destruct in order to conceal the secrets of Orochimaru's research.

                                for the Fourth Raikage during the Kage Summit. In contrast to his master, he is
                                easygoing and tends to apologize, which the Raikage chastises him for. He is taught by
                                the Third Raikage on the arts of black lightning, shaping it in the form of black
                                panther, and also possesses the Storm Style kekkei genkai, a mixture of lightning and
                                water elements that forms flowing lightning. During the Fourth Ninja War, Darui leads
                                the First Division specializing in mid-range battles. Sometime between the war's end and
                                the series epilogue, he becomes the Fifth Raikage (五代目雷影, Godaime Raikage). During

                                Upon dedicating his life to Orochimaru, he became the leader of the formerly-named Sound
                                Five (音隠れの忍五人衆, Otogakure no Shinobi Gonin Shū, literally meaning: Hidden Sound Shinobi

                                Kimimaro's abilities and had him locked up in a cage unless needed for battle.</p>
                            <p>The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason
                                other than the desire to kill and show off their ferocity. Having underestimated their
                                opponents' defences, they were slaughtered, with Kimimaro the sole survivor. Wandering
                                soon after, Kimimaro was eventually found by Orochimaru, and recruited as one of his

                                numeral IX under his left eye and bestowed a Kama mark by Jigen to be made into a living

                                physiology at a cellular level. For reasons yet to be revealed, Kawaki left Kara and

                            <p class="card-text">Konan (小南) is the only female ninja in Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto
                                originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being a
                                partner of Nagato, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a
                                child by one of Amegakure's many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves
                                under Nagato, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as "God's angel". While under
                                Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, using it as
                                a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of
                                paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for
                                attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan's abilities are restricted
                                when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is
                                able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her
                                paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and leaves
                                the organization. Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's
                                Rinnegan eyes. She fights him, but is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's
                                resting place. In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka and in the
                                English anime, her voice actress is Dorothy Elias-Fahn.</p>

                            (ヒラメカレイ), but after Zabuza Momochi and Kisame Hoshigaki are killed, he becomes the only real
                            one left of the Swordsmen; in addition, he is the only one affiliated with the village at
                            the beginning of the series. Chojuro frequently annoys Ao because he stutters and seems to
                            lack self-confidence. After accompanying the Mizukage to the Kage Summit, he helps her guard
                            the daimyō of the Shinobi Countries, and is able to gain enough self-confidence to help
                            Naruto defeat Black Zetsu. He later becomes the Sixth Mizukage (六代目水影, Rokudaime Mizukage)
                            sometime after the war. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Kouki Miyata, while Brian

                        <p>Despite his membership in the elite Seven Swordsmen group, Chōjūrō is a shy individual and
                            seems to lack confidence in his abilities. He also greatly respects and admires the Fifth
                            Mizukage, as he commented inwardly on wanting to protect her "beautiful smile". By the time
                            of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Mei has noted that he has become a lot more confident in
                            himself as seen when he cut down Black Zetsu without reservation and then declares to the
                            Fifth that as a member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he would guard the area
                            with his life. Years later after becoming the Sixth Mizukage, Chōjūrō has seemed to grow
                            well into his new role, appearing much calmer and confident in his abilities.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Might Duy (マイト・ダイ, Maito Dai), often referred to as the Eternal
                        Genin (万年下忍, Mannen Genin), was a shinobi of Konohagakure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Duy was a proud and upbeat man. Like his son, he was overzealous,
                        regularly using a "nice guy" pose, thanking people who were otherwise
                        chiding him for his behaviour, or low rank. He believed strongly that
                        one must have confidence in themselves in order to achieve anything.
                        He also believed that one's true youth only ends when one turns their back
                        on their beliefs and joy. Duy had a very strong relationship to his son,
                        constantly pushing Guy to be his best and lifting his spirits when upset; a
                        relationship that is parallel to Guy and his disciple, Rock Lee. A committed
                        man, he had no fear in facing his enemies, nor in sacrificing his life for Guy's
                        sake. Duy would pass on to Guy the belief that the truest expression of strength
                        was not defeating a powerful opponent, but defending the ones he loved.

                            Naruto belongs to. She was originally from Kusagakure and later another unnamed village, but
                            after the latter was destroyed she was taken in by Orochimaru, eventually becoming a loyal
                            servant to him</p>
                        <p>After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and
                            decided to join Taka to be at his side.[ch. 482] Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke
                            during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by
                            Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time.She later met up with Sasuke to confront
                            him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she moved on from Sasuke due to
                            wanting him to be happy and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Sarada. Karin is a
                            Sensor Type, able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing
                            Naruto's chakra as "bright and warm".</p>
                        <p>Karin has been praised for her abilities by both Obito Uchiha and Orochimaru, the latter
                            deciding to take her with him for that reason. Despite being mostly a non-combatant,
                            Orochimaru referred to Karin as one of his good experiments,[4] and had enough faith in her
                            skills to put her in charge of the Southern Hideout's prison, since she made escaping
                            impossible. Karin later demonstrated these skills most predominantly during the Fourth
                            Shinobi World War, where she destroyed much of Tobi's giant wooden statue.</p>

                            mature, calm, and generally silent, only speaking when needed. The word she has a tendency
                            to say most is "cool" (クール,
                            kūru). She has also shown a great level of self-control as she was able to refrain from
                            using the word "cool" during her
                            battle against the Gold and Silver Brothers — something both her brother, and later Darui
                            would fail at. Because of her
                            calm personality, even during missions, the Fourth Raikage considers her to be a valuable
                            and capable kunoichi,

                            battle. She is also very knowledgeable, as demonstrated by her in-depth knowledge of the
                            Gold and Silver Brothers and
                            the four mythical weapons in their possession.</p>

                        <p>Remon grew up close to her distant relative Kankitsu Akitsuki. To help hold off the growing
                            curse in her from erasing her memories, she was given a special hair-clip inherited from her
                            ancestor Kuen. By age twenty, due to the curse, a mark appeared on her left palm, putting
                            her at risk of gradually losing memories. Ultimately, she was betrothed to Kankitsu to
                            subdue the curse for another hundred years. Soon afterwards, Remon became troubled at how
                            cold Kankitsu suddenly became.</p>

                        <p>Ryūgan was presumed to be the youngest of his group. This, however, didn't put a limit to his
                            prideful and arrogant attitude. During his battle with Kankurō and the Konoha shinobi, he
                            boasted about how they were all going to die by his blade. Ryūgan also showed great pride in
                            his weapon, the Garian Sword. Ryūgan also showed a little soft side of him.
                            Ryūgan was a slender boy, with green eyes that were outlined by blue eye-shadow. His blue
                            hair slightly popped out of his white forehead protector, with the rest neatly combed
                            throughout his head. Around his neck was a white scarf that reached down to his pants.
                            Ryūgan wore a tight, purple sleeveless shirt which revealed his abdomen. On his arms were
                            purple arm warmers with brown straps that secured them onto his arms. His grey baggy pants
                            were fastened by a thick, brown belt. The lower part of his pants was tucked into his
                            sandals. Ryūgan kept his sword on his back.</p>

                            Exams, which would be held in Konohagakure and Sunagakure.Once entering the exams, Matsuri
                            and her teammates were randomly split into different rooms to take the written test. On a
                            monitor, Shikamaru Nara explained that everyone only needs to answer one question on the
                            test, but their team's combined score must equal exactly 100 points to pass. While everyone
                            was struggling to find a way to contact their team members,
                            Yukata couldn't even solve the written problems themselves. After time is up, Shikamaru
                            revealed a bonus question. She, like her teammates, left the question unanswered, and
                            ultimately her team passed the first round. However, a preliminary round had to be held to
                            lessen the many participants there were which involved a race to Suna where only the first
                            30 teams to arrive at the destination would qualify for the second phase.
                            Yukata is a fair-skinned girl with long, dark hair and large, brown eyes framed by
                            noticeable eyelashes. She wears the standard attire of the Sunagakure shinobi with a flak
                            jacket, a dark skirt, two arm-guards and the forehead protector of the Allied Shinobi
                            Forces. During the Chūnin Exams, she wore a grey midriff vest over a short plain shirt,
                            revealing her bare stomach. She already wore her arm-guards and the skirt. Additionally, she
                            wore black stockings and a Sunagakure forehead protector.</p>

                            the village.
                            Sora's father, Kazuma, collected the chakra, and sealed it into Sora's body, five years
                            after the attack, to produce a
                            partial copy of the Nine-Tails, turning Sora into a pseudo-jinchūriki. As a child, Sora's
                            only known family was his father Kazuma,
                            who he looked up to greatly and wanted to follow in his footsteps, later believing him to
                            have been killed. After his father's
                            presumed death, Sora went to live with the monks of the Fire Temple. At the temple, Sora
                            trained hard in hopes of some day avenging
                            his father and clearing his name, as Sora refused to believe what a horrible man people
                            claimed him to be. One day, shortly after
                            having Kurama's chakra sealed within him according to Kazuma, Sora went berserk, unleashed
                            Kurama's chakra sealed within him, and
                            destroyed the temple, a place otherwise believed to be an indestructible fortress.
                            Afterwards, he was loathed by some of the monks
                            of the temple, and soon began receiving the same ostracising treatment that Naruto Uzumaki
                            experienced while he was young.</p>

                            minor goons in the series.
                            However, Sasuke and the rest of the lower ranking ninjas were outmatched. When they learn
                            about Orochimaru's real plan, which is to test out Sasuke's powers, Dosu defies Orochimaru
                            and tries to kill Sasuke during the competition. Dosu ultimately fails.
                            As for his teammates, Orochimaru kills them and uses two of the members' bodies to resurrect
                            the first and second Hokage during the Konoha invasion.</p>

                            chakra, Madara's Sharingan evolved into the Rinnegan. As the eyes' original owner, only he
                            could use them to their maximum power. He was able to switch between both dōjutsu. With the
                            Rinnegan, Madara could use all of the abilities of the Six Paths Technique, such as the
                            Preta Path to absorb chakra and the Deva Path to perform Chibaku Tensei. He could also use
                            the Outer Path to create chakra chains that could restrain all nine tailed beasts and black
                            receivers for various melee and supplementary purposes. Through the usage of his Rinnegan
                            with that of his Sharingan, Madara could summon meteorites to cause widespread
                            destruction.</p>

                            fought drenched in the blood of others and her own for the sake of the village.
                            After taking office as Mizukage, Mei came across challenges while struggling to undo the
                            negative inheritance left by the Fourth Mizukage and the village's own history. In the
                            anime, during the aftermath of Yagura's passing, Mei received a letter from the Fifth
                            Kazekage and Hokage, asking if Kirigakure would participate in the upcoming Chūnin Exams
                            that their villages were hosting. After listening to her aids, Mei informed the Hokage that

                            Uzushiogakure's Uzumaki clan. After migrating to Konohagakure, she married Hashirama Senju,
                            the village's First Hokage, and later became the first jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails
                            following the events at the Valley of the End.</p>
                        <p>After Hashirama's victory against Madara Uchiha at the Valley of the End and obtaining Kurama
                            from him, Mito sealed the tailed beast within herself, becoming its first jinchūriki.
                            Despite the seal's strength, it almost broke when she was going through childbirth. Towards
                            the final years of her life, it was decided that a new host for Kurama would have to be
                            found.
                            Kushina Uzumaki, one of Mito's clansmen, was then selected for the role due to her special
                            chakra.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Metal Lee bears a strong resemblance to his father: he has shiny
                                    black hair worn in a bowl-cut style, dark eyes, and very thick eyebrows. His eyes,
                                    however, are noticeably sharper. His likeness is further perpetuated by his attire:
                                    he wears a green jumpsuit with orange leg warmers, a scarf and bandages over his
                                    hands. </p>
                                <p>Metal is a very respectful and honourable young man who tends to talk exclusively
                                    without contractions in his words. He apparently gained this nature from his father,
                                    Rock Lee, whom he has sincere respect for, and likewise his father's sensei, Might
                                    Guy. Also like his father, he is a hot-blooded and dedicated shinobi, exemplified
                                    from consistently participating in his father's daily gruesome training regime. At
                                    the same time however, he has stage fright, as when too many people watch him, he
                                    locks up and becomes unable to move or perform properly
                                    Metal specialises in the Strong Fist-style taijutsu, and, when not overwhelmed by
                                    his insecurities, lives up to his reputation as a genius even within his
                                    taijutsu-excelling clan.</p>

                                    Garaga (ガラガ, Garaga) is a snake inhabiting the Ryuchi Cave and was Boruto Uzumaki's
                                    former personal summon.
                                    Prior to the events of Boruto, he was a very violent snake who held immense distain
                                    towards humans due to his betrayal by his former summoner.
                                </p>
                                <p>Garaga first appeared during the Mitsuki Disappearance Arc in the Boruto series.
                                    During this arc, a core member of Boruto's team, Mitsuki, seemed to have betrayed
                                    the village by contributing to an attack alongside two unknown assailants.
                                    After these events, Boruto, Sarada, and the new generation of the InoShikaCho team
                                    were sent to Ryuchi Cave where they were tasked by the White Snake Sage to take his
                                    reverse scale.
                                    This brought them into conflict with Garaga who had the scale. After having a
                                    conversation with Boruto about the importance of trust, Garaga made a deal with
                                    Boruto.
                                    Garaga was to enter a summoning contact with Boruto in order to help him find
                                    Mitsuki. If Mitsuki was brought back and proved to be a friend of Boruto's all
                                    along, Garaga would acknowledge Boruto as an equal.
                                    However, if Mitsuki is revealed to be a traitor to both Boruto and the Hidden Leaf
                                    Village, then Garaga can eat Boruto.
                                    After finding Mitsuki, who was working undercover to bring down the two assailants,
                                    Garaga helped Boruto uncover the whole conspiracy and save the village.
                                    At the end, he was shown that he could trust humans again and said his goodbyes to
                                    Boruto and his team.

                                    Monkey King: Enma (猿猴王・猿魔, Enkōō: Enma) is the personal summon of Hiruzen Sarutobi,
                                    otherwise known as the Third Hokage.

                                    Enma first appeared in the series when Orochimaru first attacked the Hidden Leaf
                                    Village during Naruto's First Chuunin Exams.
                                    During this event, Hiruzen summoned Monkey King: Enma to help him fight the
                                    Imperfect Resurrections of the First and Second Hokage, as well as Orochimaru
                                    himself.
                                    Unfortunately, despite his efforts, Enma was not able let the Third Hokage finish of
                                    Orochimaru with the Reaper Death Seal Jutsu, leaving Orochimaru's arms paralyzed.
                                    Since then, Enma has only appeared in flashbacks regarding the Third Hokage. The
                                    only other monkey summon in the series is Enra, who is Konohamaru's current summon.
