                            series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                            strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or
                            Leaf Village).</p>
                        <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra,
                            which is much greater than
                            the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                            Naruto his power unless they
                            were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his
                            name, Kurama. At this
                            point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                            Uchiha Clan. He's the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha and also the reason for Sasuke's need
                            for more power, which resulted in his defection from The Leaf
                            in search of Orochimaru. Itachi is a member of the akatsuki organization and is partnered
                            with Kisame Hoshigaki, a former member of the seven ninja swordsmen of the hidden mist.
                            Before joining the Akatsuki and defecting the
                            leaf village, Itachi was a member of the hidden leaf's Anbu</p>
                        <p>It is later revealed that Itachi killed the clan because they were planning a coup on the
                            leaf village and Itachi was working to prevent that. In the end Itachi dies by Sasuke's

                            mission.
                            Besides that Shisui was a good friend to Itachi Uchiha. Unfortunately his time didn't lasted
                            longer,
                            Danzo Shimura (Head of Black Ops) wanted his Sharingan and Shisui never wanted to hand his

                            guy. He gave his eyes to his best friend who was like a younger brother to him and asked him
                            to protect it.
                            He jumped off the cliff and then took his last breaths.

                  <p class="card-text">Sai Yamanaka is the Anbu Chief of Konohagakure's Yamanaka clan. Prior to this, he was a Root member. As per standard Root training, Sai was conditioned to remove all emotions and as such, had difficulty connecting with others. When he is added to Team Kakashi as a replacement for the rogue Sasuke Uchiha, Sai begins to learn more about people's feelings and tries to develop his personality and identity by forming genuine bonds and rediscovering the emotions he was taught to suppress.</p>
                  <p>Sai was orphaned as a child and recruited into Root, a secret branch of the Anbu under the leadership of Danzō Shimura. There, he was raised and conditioned to have no personality, personal connections, or a name; "Sai" being given to him for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi. Though largely successful in this regard, Sai retained an interest in art. When Shin, an older Root member, discovered Sai's drawing ability, he encouraged Sai's talent and they became very close.

                    Over time, Sai came to think of Shin as an older brother and looked up to him. Unfortunately, the final step in Root training called for the two to fight to the death to eradicate all remaining emotions. Before that happened, however, Shin died of an unnamed illness and Sai's Root training suppressed most of the memories he had of him.In the anime, Sai and Shin were forced to fight by Danzō but Shin, knowing that he was dying anyway, told Sai to report to Danzō that he had killed him in battle. Before dying, Shin told his brother that he had to suppress his feelings, and to live for the both of them.</p>

Her Abilities include her incredible strength which she obtained by learning how to focus chakra into precise points and release it all at once to cause massive damage to her enemies. Her other main ability is the use of Medical Ninjutsu which is the best in Konoha.</p>
          <p>Tsunade can summon Katsuyu, a giant slug that is intelligent and very loyal to her. Katsuyu is able to perform a number of jutsu for which Tsunade does not seem to have her own equivalent, such as spitting acid and spliting into smaller slugs, making her useful for accomplishing tasks Tsunade cannot.</p>

          <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.</p>

In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name Kinoe.

          <p class="card-text">Sanae is confident, energetic and dutiful, sometimes too much so, and tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She also appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>
