                            <p class="card-text">Naruto Uzumaki is the main protagonist in the popular manga and anime
                                series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                                strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha
                                (or
                                Leaf Village).</p>
                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                chakra,
                                which is much greater than
                                the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                                Naruto his power unless they
                                were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by
                                his
                                name, Kurama. At this
                                point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                            Chōmei (重明), more commonly known as the Seven-Tails (七尾, Nanabi, Shichibi), is one of the nine tailed beasts. 
                            It was last sealed within Fū from Takigakure.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Chōmei resembles a blue, armoured kabutomushi (カブトムシ, rhinoceros beetle), with six of its seven tails resembling green 
                            insect wings, along with an actual seventh tail, all growing from the end of its abdomen. The stem of the tail is green but 
                            the wings are orange. Its eyes seem to be covered by a helmet-like skull, from inside of which, an orange glow can be seen. 
                            It also has spike protrusions on its shoulders and a row of slits on each shoulder, and six legs — three on each side. The legs 
                            are also covered by the blue armour, with the exception of extreme ends which are green in colour. It has two pincers with three 
                            parts on its face, covering a mouth full of sharp teeth.[8] On its back behind its head, it has a large two sectioned horned protrusion. 
                            During the last remaining days of the Sage of Six Paths, Chōmei was just in its larval stage of development, was completely green aside 
                            from its tails which were a lighter shade of green, having seven full tails instead of wings, and red eyes.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            As a tailed beast, Chōmei possesses extremely large amounts of chakra that it can share with others and can use the Tailed Beast Ball. 
                            Using its wings, it can emit blinding powder and has the ability to fly. It also utilises insect-based attacks, such as biting or ramming

                        <p>Guy is perhaps most fully represented by his "nice guy" pose: a thumbs up, wink, and winning smile -
                            complete with the proverbial ping. The pose captures his optimism and confidence, as by striking the
                            pose he is promising that whatever words accompany it are either true now or will become true in time.
                            It represents his energy, as he will, through his understood-only-to-himself-and-select-others "Power of Youth (青春, seishun)",
                            enthusiastically seek to live up to his promise no matter the personal investment doing so will require of him.
                            It plumbs his deep emotional well because he only reserves it for the most important promises to the most
                            important people for the most important reasons, and as such tears frequently stream down the face of somebody
                            (inevitably Guy) when the pose is struck. He is a very driven and committed man, both to his principles and his training,
                            constantly pushing himself to go beyond his limits. In the anime, it was shown that even after gaining 
                            effective use ninjutsu and genjutsu, he makes it a personal choice to rely solely on taijutsu whenever possible,
                            even prefers unconvincing disguises rather than the Transformation Technique.</p>

                                It also has spike protrusions on its shoulders and a row of slits on each shoulder, and
                                six legs — three on each side. The legs
                                are also covered by the blue armour, with the exception of extreme ends which are green
                                in colour. It has two pincers with three
                                parts on its face, covering a mouth full of sharp teeth.[8] On its back behind its head,
                                it has a large two sectioned horned protrusion.

                                Using its wings, it can emit blinding powder and has the ability to fly. It also

                                the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death, she was partnered with Nagato, who had

                                taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only member to call him by his name. After

                                death, Konan defected from Akatsuki and became the de facto village head of Amegakure.

                            <p>When she was young, Konan's family was killed during the Second Shinobi World War, and

                                was left to fend for herself.[4] Some time later, Yahiko found her, and the two worked
                                together to survive. Not long after that, Konan went for a walk and found a young, dying
                                Nagato and his dog, Chibi. She rescued him and brought him back to their hideout.

                                the three became best friends. They eventually encountered the Sannin, who gave them

                                food. Konan impressed them by making an elaborate flower out of the paper wrappers left
                                behind as a sign of gratitude. When Orochimaru suggested to kill them so they would not

                            <p>Ebisu is portrayed as a stern and "by-the-book" type of person. Initially, he expressed

                                for Naruto Uzumaki, and believed he was nothing but a worthless nuisance and mocked his

                                anything.
                                Upon seeing what Naruto had done for Konohamaru his perspective changed drastically,
                                and later the village during Pain's assault on it, he chose not to surrender Naruto's

                                and would rather be killed. He is also rather attached to his pupils, and has shown
                                immense pride
                                in them, such as when Konohamaru performed the Rasengan on Pain while rescuing Ebisu.

                                But alas, such hopes were dashed immediately when fans realized that not only was this
                                big baddie only revealed at the very last second (without any foreshadowing, for that

                                works in a flower shop with her parents, she's a Ninja, and she's blond. Aside from that
                                she's taken a journey that has completely changed her personality. In the beginning Ino
                                was
                                something of the Queen Bee in the School, very popular, pretty, and charismatic. She and
                                Sakura were good friends right up until the time they started noticing Sasuke, and than
                                they
                                (like many other of the girls) started plotting to date him. Up until that point Ino was
                                very encouraging to Sakura trying to break her out of her shell, but after that point
                                focusing on sabotaging her. They both were quick to insult each other and belittle the
                                abilities of the other. This conflict didn't come to outright blows however. At least
                                not
                                until the Chunin tournament.</p>

                                fond of them, and was willing to risk his own life to protect them against the

                                suggested that he was not yet strong enough to defeat Kisame, showing it to be a sign of

                                Besides that Shisui was a good friend to Itachi Uchiha. Unfortunately his time didn't

                                to protect it.
                                He jumped off the cliff and then took his last breaths.

                                of his greedines but the truth remained uncovered till the last chapters.

                            <p class="card-text">Sai Yamanaka is the Anbu Chief of Konohagakure's Yamanaka clan. Prior
                                to
                                this, he was a Root member. As per standard Root training, Sai was conditioned to remove
                                all
                                emotions and as such, had difficulty connecting with others. When he is added to Team
                                Kakashi as a replacement for the rogue Sasuke Uchiha, Sai begins to learn more about
                                people's feelings and tries to develop his personality and identity by forming genuine
                                bonds
                                and rediscovering the emotions he was taught to suppress.</p>
                            <p>Sai was orphaned as a child and recruited into Root, a secret branch of the Anbu under
                                the
                                leadership of Danzō Shimura. There, he was raised and conditioned to have no
                                personality,
                                personal connections, or a name; "Sai" being given to him for the purposes of joining
                                Team
                                Kakashi. Though largely successful in this regard, Sai retained an interest in art. When
                                Shin, an older Root member, discovered Sai's drawing ability, he encouraged Sai's talent
                                and
                                they became very close.

                                Over time, Sai came to think of Shin as an older brother and looked up to him.
                                Unfortunately, the final step in Root training called for the two to fight to the death
                                to
                                eradicate all remaining emotions. Before that happened, however, Shin died of an unnamed
                                illness and Sai's Root training suppressed most of the memories he had of him.In the
                                anime,
                                Sai and Shin were forced to fight by Danzō but Shin, knowing that he was dying anyway,
                                told
                                Sai to report to Danzō that he had killed him in battle. Before dying, Shin told his
                                brother
                                that he had to suppress his feelings, and to live for the both of them.</p>

                                to stop Sasuke and the Akatsuki, the five Kages decided to meet at the Summit hosted by
                                Mifune.</p>
                            <p> While ninjas focuse on chakaras and human bonds, the Samurais' chakaras focuse on
                                spirituality and the way of life.

                                The shinobi never meddled with the warriors because their Iado ability can outspeed a
                                ninja. Hence it made perfect sense to hold an alliance meeting in neutral territory
                                where samurais have the upper hand in terms of tactical advantage.

                                Yet, the warriors couldn’t stop Sasuke from intervening at the Summit. The moderator,
                                Mifune, is a veteran samurai who couldn’t even come close to stopping Sasuke-- to the
                                point that the five Kages had to intervene with their ninjutsu skills. The warriors, who
                                are famed to outmatch ninjas, were defeated by one underage boy.</p>

                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In
                                the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against
                                Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the final against Shikamaru. In this
                                fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun
                                this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru
                                runs out of chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion
                                of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when
                                Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down,
                                though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro
                                carry him home.

                                    she easily defeats and continues to the final against Shikamaru. In this fight

                                    tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a

                                    in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra
                                    and he
                                    gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins,

                                    forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue

                                    Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with

                                    blue eyes and "Believe it!" verbal tic. He also inherits his maternal family's
                                    Gentle Fist technique despite not inheriting the Byakugan, unlike his sister
                                    Himawari. </p>
                                <p>Just as his father pulled pranks to have his existence acknowledged, Boruto commits
                                    mischief to get his father's attention after his rise to Hokage, such as defacing
                                    the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue. Boruto also admires
                                    his father's rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his
                                    father, later being accepted as his student.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Yamato is introduced during Part II of the series as an ANBU member
                                    who becomes a substitute leader in Team Kakashi. "Yamato" is not his real name,
                                    rather a codename assigned for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi.</p>
                                <p>Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as Tenzo, Yamato
                                    believes ninja should be able to look after themselves to the point of leaving
                                    behind any he sees as a hindrance. During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by
                                    Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style.
                                    In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to
                                    serve as a Root operative under the code name Kinoe. After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe
                                    would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.</p>

                                    and tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She also
                                    appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having
                                    knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside
                                    World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in
                                    "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a
                                    complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as
                                    seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is
                                    adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>

                                <p>Sakumo was also responsible for the killing of Sasori's parents. Sakumo's life took a
                                    turn for the worse when he chose to save the lives of his comrades instead of
                                    completing the mission. Sakumo was rebuked for his decision and in the end, he fell
                                    into despair and then committed suicide.</p>

                                    behind any he sees as a hindrance. During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by
                                    Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style.
                                    In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to
                                    serve as a Root operative under the code name Kinoe. After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe
                                    would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.</p>

                                    appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having
                                    knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside
                                    World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in
                                    "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a
                                    complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as
                                    seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is
                                    adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.</p>

                                    inherited the gift of predicting the future; this gift was proven to be very
                                    accurate, which led many people to shun her in fear, leaving her isolated and
                                    lonely, with only her mother to comfort and accompany her. Under her mother's
                                    orders, Shion was not taught any ninjutsu by the guards, in the hopes she can live a
                                    normal life and not become a terrible threat should she be corrupted. Miroku also
                                    gave Shion a bell as a protective charm, which, unknown to Shion at the time, was
                                    imbued with tremendous powers to protect her when necessary. Shion ultimately saw
                                    her mother die when she sealed Mōryō away. Shion herself was then tasked to train in
                                    the method to seal away Mōryō again should the situation arise. </p>

                                    leaning on snakes for support in a fight. It's Kabuto's ability to sniff out other
                                    people's insecurities and use them to his advantage in battle -- like Tsunade's fear

                                    he deceived into believing that he had created the entity. White Zetsu (白ゼツ, Shiro
                                    Zetsu) was originally part of an army that Kaguya was assembling to fend off her
                                    kinsmen, consisting of humans mutated into drones after being assimilated by the Ten
                                    Tails during Kaguya's previous Infinite Tsukuyomi. Black Zetsu and White Zetsu
                                    operate in symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As
                                    White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or
                                    vegetation to quickly travel to a new location, and use spores to create clones of
                                    himself or whoever he touches.[ch. 289] This makes Zetsu not only of use to the
                                    Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those
                                    the organization does not want found.[ch. 255, 261] Another of the White Zetsu
                                    retrieved from the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as Guruguru (グルグル) due to the
                                    spiral-shaped pattern on his body, later named Tobi (トビ), served as an exosuit for
                                    Obito while the youth got used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by
                                    Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu goes into hiding, later
                                    merging itself onto Obito to force the human to resurrect Madara.[ch. 575, 656]
                                    Ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan runs its course, Black Zetsu reveals his
                                    true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for
                                    Kaguya to inhabit.[ch. 674] Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict
                                    between the Senju and Uchiha, while helping Kaguya fight Naruto and Sasuke. He is
                                    eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severs Kaguya's arm. As Kaguya
                                    is sealed away once more, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so
                                    he would not make another attempt to free his creator.[ch. 681, 688, 690] Tobi,
                                    having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style, before
                                    ejecting him once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is cast, crumbles away after the jutsu is
                                    canceled, with his former captive the only witness to his death</p>

                                <p class="card-text">[Gaara (我愛羅, Gaara) is a shinobi of Sunagakure. He was made the
                                    jinchūriki of the One-Tailed Shukaku before he was born, causing the villagers of
                                    Suna
                                    to fear him as a monster. With nobody to connect to, Gaara grew up hating the world
                                    and
                                    looking out only for himself, giving his life meaning by killing anyone he came
                                    across
                                </p>
                                <p>Gaara was raised in isolation during his early life, taught ninjutsu by his father
                                    and
                                    cared for by his maternal uncle, Yashamaru. When he was allowed to roam around the
                                    village, Gaara would try to connect with the villagers, being kind to them and
                                    offering
                                    them any assistance he could. However, being a jinchūriki made the villagers
                                    frightened
                                    of Gaara; adults avoided him and, when they couldn't, treated him delicately while
                                    children would run from him on sight. Gaara would try to assure them he meant no
                                    harm,
                                    but in the process would inadvertently injure or even kill them with his sand. Gaara
                                    did
                                    not understand this pain he caused others because his sand protected him from all
                                    injury. When he was six years old, Gaara asked Yashamaru to explain pain to him.</p>

                                    concerned with the welfare of his village.[ch. 546] He loathed the Second Tsuchikage

                                    distinctively, he has mouths on the palms of his hands, which he uses to create
                                    special bombs out of clay. Indeed, the name Deidara is related to the Japanese word
                                    for “mud.”</p>
                                <p>During his time as an Iwagakure shinobi, Deidara came to know Ōnoki, and became
                                    familiarised with his fighting style.[3] He possessed the Explosion Release kekkei
                                    genkai which he used as a member of the Explosion Corps.[4] Though praised highly
                                    for his clay sculptures, Deidara's desire to reach even greater heights in his art
                                    resulted with him stealing one of his village's kinjutsu that allows one to knead
                                    their chakra into substances.[1] Using explosive clay to take out his pursuers,
                                    Deidara found the art he had desired: the Art of a Single Moment (一瞬の芸術, Isshun no
                                    Geijutsu).[1] Remembering the first moment whenever he detonated his explosive clay,
                                    he recalls the process that allowed him to reach this art. Since then, Deidara
                                    became a missing-nin and offered his services as a bomber to insurgents in various
                                    countries.[1]</p>

                                    better off exploring the world with his friends. Being acquainted with Mirai
                                    Sarutobi since his birth, the two developed a sibling-like relationship during their

                                    also famously known as the Honored Siblings (御姉弟). He is a councilman in the Suna
                                    council.</p>
                                <p>He is a very calm, reserved, and apathetic person, especially when compared to his
                                    sister, who often appeared at times impulsive
                                    in her actions. He also seems to be very analytical in his thinking. Like Chiyo,
                                    Ebizō believed that the village should be strong
                                    enough to look after itself without being so reliant on the previous generation or
                                    other villages, and showed disappointment when
                                    they were so helpless in saving Kankurō from poison. He also has very long eyebrows
                                    that frame each side of his face, Along with
                                    a turban wrapped around his head.Though little is known of his skills, it was stated
                                    that he has a strong and analytical mind that
                                    served him and Sunagakure well during the previous shinobi wars and even in his old
                                    age.
                                    When Sasori's membership in the organisation came up, they changed their minds. Upon
                                    seeing the poisoned Kankurō, Ebizō commented
                                    how much the village has weakened.Much later Ebizō was saddened by his sister's
                                    death. As he had hoped it was another one of her
                                    jokes, he couldn't help but smile at how peaceful she looked.

                                    Orochimaru. After developing a fixation on the Uchiha clan, more specifically
                                    Itachi, he took the Uchiha name for himself and severed ties with Orochimaru, taking
                                    his "sons" with him. Believing that peace was detrimental to human evolution, Shin
                                    began a plot to revive the Akatsuki so that the ensuing conflict would be a catalyst
                                    to further his beliefs.</p>
                                <p>Shin was a tall and fit man with a pale complexion and no hair, as well as a
                                    horizontal scar that ran from his right temple to the bridge of his nose. He also
                                    lacked any teeth, having used them all for his cloning experiments, and his right
                                    arm had been amputated above the elbow. His most striking features, however, were
                                    the numerous Sharingan implanted on his head and torso.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Itachi is one of the main villains in Naruto, as the murderer of
                                    the entire Uchiha Clan. He's the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha and also the reason
                                    for Sasuke's need for more power, which resulted in his defection from The Leaf in
                                    search of Orochimaru. Itachi is a member of the akatsuki organization and is
                                    partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki, a former member of the seven ninja swordsmen of the
                                    hidden mist. Before joining the Akatsuki and defecting the leaf village, Itachi was
                                    a member of the hidden leaf's Anbu.</p>
                                <p>Itachi was a true prodigy during his time at the academy, and quickly graduated and
                                    became a Chunnin. After ascending beyond Chunnin Itachi joined up with the ANBU
                                    squad and quickly rose through the ranks there. Itachi began to distance himself
                                    from his one time close brother, Sasuke, and one night in genocidal manner murdered
                                    the entire Uchiha clan, which set Sasuke against Itachi and on his quest for
                                    revenge.

                                    It is later revealed that Itachi killed the clan because they were planning a coup
                                    on the leaf village and Itachi was working to prevent that. In the end Itachi dies
                                    by Sasuke's hands, just as he always wanted.

                                    To be used in the Fourth Shinobi World War, Itachi (alongside others) is later
                                    brought back to the world of the living by Edo Tensai - a jutsu used by Kabuto to
                                    revive the dead and remotely control them. After triggering the Kotoamatsuki
                                    technique, Itachi breaks free of Kabuto's control and teams up with Naruto and
                                    Killer Bee who together defeat the revived Nagato. Itachi then goes on to have an
                                    abrupt and brief reunion with Sasuke, and together they are currently fighting
                                    Kabuto in his hideout.

                                    Typically in games Itachi is portrayed as a villain and utilizes his signature style
                                    of fighting with genjutsu (illusion techniques) and going to his strongest genjutsu
                                    (depending on the opponent) called: Tsukuyomi, which is only available through the
                                    awakening of the Mangekyo Sharingan in members of the Uchiha Clan. This allows him
                                    to take his opponents to an alternate reality in which they endure three days of
                                    torture in 3 minutes time. Other then Tsukuyomi, he possess 2 techniques available
                                    to him through the Mangekyo Sharingan. A Ninjutsu called: Amaterasu, which can
                                    engulf anything he sets his sight on in black fire, which is said to be as hot the
                                    the Sun itself. A technique called: Susanoo, which activates on the condition of
                                    having used Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu previously and in any order, but while sustaing
                                    the same session of the Mangekyo Sharingan; Susanoo will create a gigantic ethereal
                                    warrior who will sorround Itachi's body and fight on his behalf with the Yata Shield
                                    (can reflect attacks) and the Totsuka Sword which anything it cuts is send into a
                                    blissful dream genjutsu forever inside the sake container from which the sword
                                    sprouts out from.

                                <p class="card-text">Momoshiki was typically calm, collected, and calculating. However,
                                    he had been prone to demonstrate sadistic tendencies, which was shown during his and
                                    Kinshiki's attack on Konoha, where he laughed after seeing distressed citizens while
                                    firing his elemental attacks. Momoshiki also had a severe superiority complex and
                                    thought very lowly of people other than himself, calling Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, and
                                    Sarada "lowly beings". Likewise, he also cared very little for other people, even
                                    his own father. When he was in a difficult situation, he absorbed Kinshiki without a
                                    second thought in order to claim more power for himself. Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki was a
                                    member of the Ōtsutsuki clan's main family, sent to investigate the whereabouts of
                                    Kaguya and her God Tree and then attempting to cultivate a new one out of the chakra
                                    of the Seventh Hokage. In the process of being killed by Boruto Uzumaki, Momoshiki
                                    placed a Kāma on him, allowing his spirit to remain intact through the mark.</p>
                                <p>Momoshiki was an extraordinarily powerful being who, alongside Kinshiki, was deemed a
                                    threat greater than Kaguya. He was capable of holding his own against multiple
                                    Kage-level opponents simultaneously, as well as defeating a perfect jinchūriki.
                                    After absorbing Kinshiki, he was able to defeat four Kage at the same time with
                                    extreme ease and he could fight near evenly with Sasuke Uchiha and Naruto Uzumaki,
                                    who both utilised the Six Paths Chakra.</p>

                                    He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate 
                                    that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. 
                                    After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's 
                                    acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the

                                    ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of 
                                    the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf.
