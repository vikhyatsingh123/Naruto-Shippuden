                            series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                            strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or
                            Leaf Village).</p>
                        <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra,
                            which is much greater than
                            the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                            Naruto his power unless they
                            were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his
                            name, Kurama. At this
                            point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Itachi is one of the main villains in Naruto, as the murderer of the entire
                            Uchiha Clan. He's the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha and also the reason for Sasuke's need
                            for more power, which resulted in his defection from The Leaf
                            in search of Orochimaru. Itachi is a member of the akatsuki organization and is partnered
                            with Kisame Hoshigaki, a former member of the seven ninja swordsmen of the hidden mist.
                            Before joining the Akatsuki and defecting the
                            leaf village, Itachi was a member of the hidden leaf's Anbu</p>
                        <p>It is later revealed that Itachi killed the clan because they were planning a coup on the
                            leaf village and Itachi was working to prevent that. In the end Itachi dies by Sasuke's
                            hands, just as he always wanted.

                            leaf village. Due to his powerful Sharingan Shisui was able to achieve every goal in his
                            mission.
                            Besides that Shisui was a good friend to Itachi Uchiha. Unfortunately his time didn't lasted
                            longer,
                            Danzo Shimura (Head of Black Ops) wanted his Sharingan and Shisui never wanted to hand his
                            eyes to a wrong
                            guy. He gave his eyes to his best friend who was like a younger brother to him and asked him
                            to protect it.
                            He jumped off the cliff and then took his last breaths.

                        <p>Although Shisui Uchiha was not known much,but his will was strong.
                            He ended up giving his life for good deeds.People thought Itachi killed him because
                            of his greedines but the truth remained uncovered till the last chapters.
