                                In the anime, as a young boy, Shinki was unable to control his power prompting Gaara to 
                                approach him. Fearful, he attacked the Kazekage, who surprised him by hugging him despite 
                                Shinki injuring him. Offering to teach Shinki how to use his power, he told Gaara his name 
                                before accepting his offer. Following the encounter, Gaara adopted him, and soon after 
                                began teaching Shinki proper control of his power and how to effectively use it in battle.

                                each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power
                                unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers

                                Konohagakure's Sarutobi clan. After later becoming a jōnin, he becomes the leader of his
                                own genin team. He strives to one day become Hokage after his idol, Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
                            <p>Konohamaru was born into the Sarutobi clan and was named after Konoha by his grandfather.
                                While being raised by his Anbu parents,[7] Konohamaru was never referred to by his name
                                by the villagers, only ever called "Honourable Grandson" (お孫様, Omago-sama) because of
                                his relationship to the Hokage. Wanting to be acknowledged as a person and not simply
                                the Hokage's grandson, Konohamaru began trying to defeat Hiruzen in order to replace him

                                series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Introduced in the series'
                                first part, he was a student of Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and one of the three
                                "Legendary Great Three Students of the God Shinobi"(Legendary Sanin)—along with
                                Orochimaru and Lady Tsunade, his former teammates.
                                Jiraiya appears as a perverted old man who occasionally returns to the village
                                Konohagakure, reporting the activities of Orochimaru and the organization Akatsuki.
                                Referred to as the "Toad Sage" and "Pervy Sage",
                                he mentors Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze and later becomes the godfather and mentor of
                                Minato's son, Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
                            <p>Jiraiya appears in two Naruto films, and as a playable character in most of the
                                franchise's video games.
                                Various pieces of merchandise based on him have been released. He has received positive
                                critical reception. Reviewers have praised Jiraiya's introduction
                                in the story and his relation with Naruto as his mentor. Out of all student-teacher
                                relationships in Naruto, Jiraiya and Naruto's are the ones Kishimoto liked the most.
                                He served as a strong father-figure to Naruto.</p>

                                She served as the Ninja Academy's Class Representative for Boruto's class. After

                                This led to Sumire's mother's illness and eventual death.
                                Sumire was profoundly affected by the loss because one of her few delights was brushing
                                her hair with her mother.
                                Over time, Sumire lost even the memory of her mother's voice.

                                him.
                                Some time after this, Fukasaku taught Jiraiya senjutsu.
                                Fukasaku was later present when the Great Toad Sage called

                            <p>Fukasaku, like his wife Shima, is considered very wise and is greatly respected
                                by all who know them well enough. In reality, he constantly bickers with Shima
                                over small things when they should focus on the bigger picture, such as the fact
                                that a battle will cause them to miss dinner. They are still close, as Shima
                                is heartbroken after Fukasaku is killed by Pain. Though Fukasaku remains serious
                                in even the worst situation, he and his wife will constantly find a reason to bicker
                                with each other. He also has a tendency to call the Great Toad Sage, "senile" for

                                a Japanese rhinoceros beetle, and compared to its Bijuu kin, is remarkably placid and
                                laid-back, which is likely why Chomei doesn't resemble typical demons in anime.</p>

                                Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan.
                                He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with
                                the intention of beginning an era of peace.
                                When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the
                                village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death.
                                Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable
                                to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito
                                shortly before his actual death.
                                Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and
                                finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his
                                final death.

                                has become the Fifth Hokage of The Hidden Leaf Village. Her grandparents are revealed to
                                be Hashirama

                            <p>Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her
                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact,
                                she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders her bare
                                hands. She is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds that most
                                others would consider impossible.
                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her forehead
                                to Creation Rebirth, a technique that releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the
                                cells in her body to heal any wound. It gives her a "immortality" in battle thateven
                                Orochimaru envied. However, because of the rapid cell regeneration, the technique
                                shortens her life similar to the Four-Tailed
                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the
                                technique, Tsunade has made the choice to only use Creation Rebirth in extremely
                                desperate situations.</p>

                                the Academy.
                                Wanting to make a strong first impression, she proclaimed to her class that she would be

                                that had brought them together. Ultimately, Minato's reciprocated feelings helped her

                                not surpass the Sage of Six Paths himself.[6] When Hagoromo later named his younger son,

                            <p>Ebisu is portrayed as a stern and "by-the-book" type of person. Initially, he expressed
                                hatred for Naruto Uzumaki, and believed he was nothing but a worthless nuisance and
                                mocked his dream of becoming Hokage as he believes
                                that only people of high lineage could amount to anything. Upon seeing what Naruto had
                                done for Konohamaru his perspective changed drastically, and later the village during
                                Pain's assault on it, he chose not to surrender
                                Naruto's location and would rather be killed. He is also rather attached to his pupils,
                                and has shown immense pride in them, such as when Konohamaru performed the Rasengan on
                                Pain while rescuing Ebisu.

                                the village system work, thus ensuring Konoha's continuity and prosperity. After his

                                all of them to escape, Tobirama volunteered to act as a decoy in place of Hiruzen. As he
                                departed, he passed the title of Hokage to Hiruzen, before being killed by Kinkaku</p>

                                There he stood behind the First watching diligently as the proceedings unfolded.
                                Eventually, his long service and dedication earned him the appointment of Second

                                During his tenure, A entered Kumogakure into a formal alliance with Konohagakure,

                                It is unknown what happened to A, but the Hokage was said to have barely escaped with

                                has ever had.
                                A's rule was punctuated by the berserk attacks of the Eight-Tails but as Kumogakure
                                couldn't afford to dispose of such a valuable war deterrent, he was forced to look for a
                                suitable jinchūriki in quick succession, after the conclusion of each rampage.
                                During one of these attacks, A fought the Eight-Tails alone, allowing his comrades to
                                escape. Their battle resulted in A receiving a self-inflicted wound to the chest after
                                he collapsed upon his own hand, which became his life's shame.
                                Since this event, he made it a personal duty to combat the Eight-Tails whenever its
                                jinchūriki lost control, eventually making even his son become part of the group that
                                supported him during these occurrences.
                                He chose to seal the Eight-Tails in the Kohaku no Jōhei, resulting in his nephew's
                                death, hoping that someone else would have more success in controlling it.
                                A is a calm and seemingly level-headed person. He is also a man of honour as seen when
                                he became outraged when Mū urges Ōnoki to take advantage of the Allied Shinobi Forces
                                after it is disbanded, telling him that he wouldn't allow the alliance to become
                                destroyed.
                                He is also a very proud and caring individual who will readily use himself as a shield
                                or "go-between" to protect his comrades. This was also exemplified when it was revealed
                                that after he received a scar from fighting the Eight-Tails, not even his son asked him
                                about it in detail, out of his respect for his father's pride.
                                A was also a firm believer of children being destined to surpass their parents, so much
                                so he told his fellow Kage who were reincarnated not to worry about being forced to
                                fight against their fellow shinobi as their children would be able to defeat them.</p>

                                Gamatatsu is a bit on the dim-witted side and has a fixation with snacks.
                                He first appeared in the series when Naruto Uzumaki accidentally summoned him during a
                                battle against Orochimaru.

                                He is the eldest son of Gamabunta and the older brother of Gamatatsu.
                                Gamakichi is rather comedic, and has the mannerisms of a smart aleck.
                                He is also often very condescending as well as light-hearted in most situations,
                                preferring the levity of talk to the seriousness of battle .
                                In Part I, he was small enough to fit on top of Naruto’s head like Akamaru could fit on
                                top of Kiba’s head and wore a blue jacket 1. In Part II, during Pain’s assault on
                                Konoha, Gamakichi had grown big enough so that Naruto could stand on his head, but was
                                still small enough that he stand on Gamabunta 1.
                                He has formed a bond with Naruto because he saved him from Gaara in his miniature

                                Isshiki Ōtsutsuki's assault on Konoha. Despite this, Amado wasn't discouraged, believing
                                he could resurrect Akebi by cloning her and transferring her memories into her into a
                                new body by preserving her brain, rather than try to develop a cure for her disease.
                                However, Amado's hopes were crushed as her daughter's clones, later named Delta, despite
                                having the same appearance and memories as Akebi, were completely different individuals.
                                Amado tried to recreate Akebi's personality multiple times, but failed to do so and
                                finally broke down, realising his daughter was gone for good. It was then when Jigen
                                approached Amado, promising to bring his daughter back to life if Amado aided him with
                                his plans, Amado accepting it immediately.During his time in Kara, he became an Inner
                                and served as the head of its research and development division, used Scientific Ninja
                                Tools to augment the various members. He also analysed the remains of Shibai Ōtsutsuki,
                                transplanting his DNA to imprint his abilities onto other Kara members. Eventually, he
                                learned a lot about the Ōtsutsuki Clan, discovering Isshiki's true motive which would
                                destroy all life on the planet, making Akebi's resurrection moot. He switched his focus
                                to destroying Isshiki, but didn't give up on resurrecting Akebi, having realised that
                                Kāma resurrection was able to accomplish the restoration of personality he failed at. He
                                even created cyborgs that exceeded Jigen's power, Ada and Daemon, but the latter quickly
                                ordered them to be eliminated. Amado imbued Ada with the Senrigan and made her become
                                irresistibly attractive to anyone who saw her except blood relatives or the Ōtsutsuki
                                Clan. He also imbued Daemon with the ability to instantly turn an opponent's attack
                                against him. Ada's entrancing ability prevented Boro from getting rid of her and her
                                brother as ordered, and Ada came to hate Amado for taking the ability to be genuinely

                        <p>In Part I, Kiba carries Akamaru around on top of his head or inside his jacket. In Part II, Akamaru grows large enough for Kiba to ride on his back, a difference Kiba fails to notice due to the amount of time they spend together. Akamaru's heightened senses, such as smell and hearing, along with Kiba's ability to communicate with him, make him a powerful tool for gathering and sharing information; he can also sense chakra with his nose, so he can judge an enemy's strength and warn Kiba if they are particularly powerful. In combat, Akamaru typically takes Kiba's form (albeit having a much more feral appearance) upon Kiba's use of Beast Human Clone (Jūjin Bunshin; English TV "Man Beast Clone"), or combining with Kiba into a single entity in more desperate situations. Because Akamaru lacks his own chakra reserves Kiba performs many of the jutsu that Akamaru takes part in, though Akamaru is able to contribute when it comes to physical attacks. Akamaru can also use Dynamic Marking (Dainamikku Mākingu) by peeing on a target with great accuracy, allowing either Kiba or Akamaru to easily find the target by scent, particularly when fused together.</p>
