                                Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan.
                                He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with
                                the intention of beginning an era of peace.
                                When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the
                                village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death.
                                Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable
                                to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito
                                shortly before his actual death.
                                Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and
                                finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his

                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact,
                                she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders her bare

                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her forehead
                                to Creation Rebirth, a technique that releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the
                                cells in her body to heal any wound. It gives her a "immortality" in battle thateven
                                Orochimaru envied. However, because of the rapid cell regeneration, the technique

                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the

                            <p>These were two former Hidden Mist shinobi, known as the Demon Brothers, who had defected

                                Kakashi and Sasuke were able to easily dispose of the Demon Brothers and keep Tazuna
                                alive. They were then tied up next to a tree and left to be arrested.

                                We never actually see the Demon Brothers being arrested in the manga and escaping from
                                being tied up is one of the most basic parts of ninja training. Were the Demon Brothers

                        <p>Born into the famed Uzumaki clan of Uzushiogakure, Kushina lived most of her youth being caught up in war, 
                        making her seek for a daily peace. At a young age she was sent to Konoha and enrolled in the Academy.
                        Wanting to make a strong first impression, she proclaimed to her class that she would be the <b>first female Hokage.</b>
                        The other kids laughed at her statement, and began calling her "Tomato" because of her then-round face and fiery red hair.
                        Since Minato proved himself to be anything but, accepted her, and liked the one thing she hated about herself, 
                        Kushina fell in love with him, now considering her red hair as the "red thread of fate" (運命の赤い糸, unmei no akai ito) 
                        that had brought them together. Ultimately, Minato's reciprocated feelings helped her with overcoming the Nine-Tails.</p>

                                joined the Akatsuki. There, he was partnered with Kakuzu,

                            <p>Hidan doesn't always seem like the most intelligent of the Akatsuki. He certainly doesn't
                                have the knack for long-term planning that Pain or Tobi do,
                                for example. Hidan does, however, much like Kakuzu, have a great understanding of
                                anatomy and just how shinobi abilities work. That's how he
                                manages to keep himself functionally immortal. That gives him an edge in a fight even
                                when he isn't using his head for strategy.</p>

                            </p>Inari first appeared to be a very tough individual, though this was just a ruse he put
                            on to hide the loneliness he felt since the death of Kaiza. He would often spend most of his
                            time in his room staring at a photo of his father, conflicted by the feelings he had of loss
                            and anger towards the man for dying, though he did so protecting their small village.

                                look for a suitable jinchūriki in quick succession, after the conclusion of each
                                rampage. During one of these attacks, he fought the Eight-Tails alone, allowing his

                                chest after he collapsed upon his own hand, which became his life's shame.</p>

                                supported him during these occurrences. He chose to seal the Eight-Tails in the Kohaku

She was later recruited into Sasuke Uchiha's group Taka, which was initially called "Hebi" at the time of its creation.</p>
				<p>Karin has been praised for her abilities by both Obito Uchiha and Orochimaru, the latter deciding to take her with him for that reason. Despite being mostly a non-combatant, Orochimaru referred to Karin as one of his good experiments,[4] and had enough faith in her skills to put her in charge of the Southern Hideout's prison, since she made escaping impossible. Karin later demonstrated these skills most predominantly during the Fourth Shinobi World War, where she destroyed much of Tobi's giant wooden statue.</p>

                            Throughout his reign he worked hard towards building peace between the other hidden villages.Before becoming the Second Raikage, he had a long tenure as the First Raikage's guard. During his service, he accompanied him to the first ever Five Kage Summit. 
                            There he stood behind the First watching diligently as the proceedings unfolded.
                            Eventually, his long service and dedication earned him the appointment of Second Raikage.
                             During his tenure, A entered Kumogakure into a formal alliance with Konohagakure, however, during the ceremony both he, and the Second Hokage were ambushed by the Gold and Silver Brothers, who were attempting to stage a coup d'état.

                             Third Lightning Shadow) of Kumogakure, renowned to be the greatest Raikage the village has ever had.
                             A's rule was punctuated by the berserk attacks of the Eight-Tails but as Kumogakure couldn't afford to dispose of such a valuable war deterrent, he was forced to look for a suitable jinchūriki in quick succession, after the conclusion of each rampage.
                             During one of these attacks, A fought the Eight-Tails alone, allowing his comrades to escape. Their battle resulted in A receiving a self-inflicted wound to the chest after he collapsed upon his own hand, which became his life's shame.
                             Since this event, he made it a personal duty to combat the Eight-Tails whenever its jinchūriki lost control, eventually making even his son become part of the group that supported him during these occurrences. 
                             He chose to seal the Eight-Tails in the Kohaku no Jōhei, resulting in his nephew's death, hoping that someone else would have more success in controlling it.
                        A is a calm and seemingly level-headed person. He is also a man of honour as seen when he became outraged when Mū urges Ōnoki to take advantage of the Allied Shinobi Forces after it is disbanded, telling him that he wouldn't allow the alliance to become destroyed. 
                            He is also a very proud and caring individual who will readily use himself as a shield or "go-between" to protect his comrades. This was also exemplified when it was revealed that after he received a scar from fighting the Eight-Tails, not even his son asked him about it in detail, out of his respect for his father's pride.
                            A was also a firm believer of children being destined to surpass their parents, so much so he told his fellow Kage who were reincarnated not to worry about being forced to fight against their fellow shinobi as their children would be able to defeat them.</p>

While initially terrified of his younger brother, Kankurō would come to believe in him and his dream to become the Kazekage like their father before them and would become one of Gaara's most loyal protectors, confidant and bodyguard.</p>
                                    <p>During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kankurō indicated signs of being a caring leader when he pulled Zaji from the explosion and protecting his group from any danger. He also shows determination during his battle against Deidara, Sasori, and Shin. Kankurō keeps Omoi from overreacting and getting anxious by telling him to win the war at all costs to protect his family and friends. When Sasori was captured inside of Kuroari, Kankurō helps make Sasori realise his true faults during his lifetime as a puppeteer which makes Sasori entrust his "Father and Mother" puppets to him.

                                        In the original Japanese, Kankurō speaks with a distinctive Yokohama dialect. He can often be heard ending his sentences with "-jan". This makes him sound tough, as this accent is often used for biker gang members or punk kids (called "yankii" in Japanese, Yokohama supposedly has many) in manga. It is possible that he was given this accent to make him sound different from the Konoha characters' standard Tokyo Japanese.</p>
