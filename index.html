                            series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                            strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or
                            Leaf Village).</p>
                        <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra,
                            which is much greater than
                            the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                            Naruto his power unless they
                            were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his
                            name, Kurama. At this
                            point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

As per standard Root training, Sai was conditioned to remove all emotions and as such, had difficulty connecting with others. When he is added to Team Kakashi as a replacement for the rogue Sasuke Uchiha, Sai begins to learn more about people's feelings and tries to develop his personality and identity by forming genuine bonds and rediscovering the emotions he was taught to suppress.</p>
                  <p>Sai was orphaned as a child and recruited into Root, a secret branch of the Anbu under the leadership of Danzō Shimura. There, he was raised and conditioned to have no personality, personal connections, or a name; "Sai" being given to him for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi. Though largely successful in this regard, Sai retained an interest in art. When Shin, an older Root member, discovered Sai's drawing ability, he encouraged Sai's talent and they became very close.

                    Over time, Sai came to think of Shin as an older brother and looked up to him. Unfortunately, the final step in Root training called for the two to fight to the death to eradicate all remaining emotions. Before that happened, however, Shin died of an unnamed illness and Sai's Root training suppressed most of the memories he had of him.In the anime, Sai and Shin were forced to fight by Danzō but Shin, knowing that he was dying anyway, told Sai to report to Danzō that he had killed him in battle. Before dying, Shin told his brother that he had to suppress his feelings, and to live for the both of them.</p>
