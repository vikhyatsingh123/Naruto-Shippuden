                    strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                    <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra, which is much greater than
                    the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power unless they
                    were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this
                    point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                Naruto, Haruno Sakura and Uchiha Sasuke. His teacher was the fourth hokage, Minato Namikaze and his teammates were Obito

                <p>He's worked and thrived at all levels, including among the ANBU. He has a summoning ability with a pack of Ninja Dogs,
                one of which speaks and all of which are excellent trackers. He's never been shown without his masks on. He wears at
                least two of them, and even his close friends don't know what he looks like.  
                Shortly after the ninja war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, after heading Obito's advice.</p>

After ascending beyond Chunnin Itachi joined up with the ANBU squad and quickly rose through the ranks there. Itachi began to distance himself from his one time close brother, Sasuke, and one night in genocidal manner murdered the entire Uchiha clan, which set Sasuke against Itachi and on his quest for revenge.</p>
                <p>It is later revealed that Itachi killed the clan because they were planning a coup on the leaf village and Itachi was working to prevent that. In the end Itachi dies by Sasuke's hands, just as he always wanted.

                    To be used in the Fourth Shinobi World War, Itachi (alongside others) is later brought back to the world of the living by Edo Tensai - a jutsu used by Kabuto to revive the dead and remotely control them. After triggering the Kotoamatsuki technique, Itachi breaks free of Kabuto's control and teams up with Naruto and Killer Bee who together defeat the revived Nagato. Itachi then goes on to have an abrupt and brief reunion with Sasuke, and together they are currently fighting Kabuto in his hideout.

Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan, his childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and the Uchiha clan. He would later become the First Hokage (初代火影, Shodai Hokage, literally meaning: First or Founding Fire Shadow) of Konohagakure. Although he was not able to achieve peace during his lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue to shape the village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.

Jiraiya started out as a pupil of the Third Hokage, along with teammates Orochimaru and Tsunade.  Some time after he and the other two left the Third's instruction they found themselves in a battle with Hanzo of the Rain village.  So impressed was Hanzo, with their abilities that he dubbed them the three sannin, or most powerful shinobi of the leaf village, and ended the current war.  <p>After that Jiraiya encountered the Toad sages in his wandering, and found his natural affinity for the sage chakra.  After returning to the village, Jiraiya reached Jonin level and became the instructor of Minato Namikaze, who would later become the Fourth Hokage and Naruto's father.</p> <p> Years later Orochimaru defected from the village and Jiraiya went in pursuit of him to bring him back (very much mirroring Naruto's work to bring Sasuke back).  However, unlike Naruto, Jiraiya decided that he could do nothing to save Orochimaru, and instead left the village in order to keep an eye on Orochimaru's plans.  This meant he was unable to take the role of Hokage as the third had hoped, and the role fell to Minato.</p>
