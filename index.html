                        <p class="card-text">Naruto Uzumaki is the main protagonist in the popular manga and anime
                            series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive,
                            strong-willed, and occasionally simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or
                            Leaf Village).</p>
                        <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's chakra,
                            which is much greater than
                            the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated each other, and would rarely grant
                            Naruto his power unless they
                            were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers to the fox by his
                            name, Kurama. At this
                            point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.</p>

                            He is the teacher (sensei) of Uzumaki
                            Naruto, Haruno Sakura and Uchiha Sasuke. His teacher was the fourth hokage, Minato Namikaze
                            and his teammates were Obito
                            Uchiha and Rin Nohara. His rival is Might Guy.</p>
                        <p>He's worked and thrived at all levels, including among the ANBU. He has a summoning ability
                            with a pack of Ninja Dogs,
                            one of which speaks and all of which are excellent trackers. He's never been shown without
                            his masks on. He wears at
                            least two of them, and even his close friends don't know what he looks like.
                            Shortly after the ninja war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village,
                            after heading Obito's advice.</p>

                            Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama
                            Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how
                            to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in
                            Madara's death.</p>
                        <p>Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to
                            complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly
                            before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled
                            and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with
                            Hashirama before his final death.</p>

                            Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his
                            clan, his childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and the Uchiha clan.</p>
                        <p>He would later become the First Hokage (初代火影, Shodai Hokage, literally meaning: First or
                            Founding Fire Shadow) of Konohagakure. Although he was not able to achieve peace during his
                            lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue to shape the village and the
                            entire shinobi world even after his death.</p>

                        <p>Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p>
