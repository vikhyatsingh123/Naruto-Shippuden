                                father was not an Uchiha.During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, her father died
                                while protecting her.From the grief brought on by his death, as well as feelings of
                                guilt that he would not have died had Izumi been stronger,Izumi eventually awakened her
                                Sharingan. She and her mother afterwards rejoined the Uchiha clan.</p>
                            <p>Izumi enrolled in Konoha's Academy a few years later.Like other girls her age, Izumi
                                developed a crush on Itachi Uchiha, a boy in the class next to hers.As such, she tried
                                to talk with him during school breaks, walk home with him after lessons, and defend him
                                from their peers' criticism. Itachi initially took the same disinterest in Izumi that he
                                had in all the other girls until discovering that she had the Sharingan, which he
                                himself had yet to awaken.He afterwards became warmer to her whenever their paths

                                Monstrous physical
                                strength, extremely advanced healing and regenerative techniques, physician/surgeon
                                level of knowledge
                                of the human body and great Chakra control. At once formed part of "The Legendary
                                Sannin" along with
                                Jiraiya and Orochimaru, and under the tutelage of the Third Hokage. Currently, she
                                has become the Fifth
                                Hokage of The Hidden Leaf Village. Her grandparents are revealed to be Hashirama
                                Senju and Mito Uzumaki.</p>
                            <p>Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her
                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra
                                and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point
                                where she can break through boulders with
                                her bare hands. She is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds
                                that most others would consider impossible.
                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her
                                forehead to Creation Rebirth, a technique that
                                releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the cells in her body to heal any wound.
                                It gives her a "immortality" in battle that
                                even Orochimaru envied. However, because of the rapid cell regeneration, the
                                technique shortens her life similar to the Four-Tailed
                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the
                                technique, Tsunade has made the choice to only use
                                Creation Rebirth in extremely desperate situations.</p>

                                They both were then seen by a ninja from Hanare's village and Kakashi put her down on

                            <p>These were two former Hidden Mist shinobi, known as the Demon Brothers, who had defected

                                Kakashi and Sasuke were able to easily dispose of the Demon Brothers and keep Tazuna
                                alive. They were then tied up next to a tree and left to be arrested.

                                We never actually see the Demon Brothers being arrested in the manga and escaping from
                                being tied up is one of the most basic parts of ninja training. Were the Demon Brothers

                                approach Indra alone periodically, goading him with praises and
                                curiosity towards Indra's true potential, even going so far as to say he could rival if
                                not surpass the Sage of Six Paths himself.[6] When Hagoromo later named his younger son,
                                Asura, as the new leader of Ninshū, Black
                                Zetsu tempted Hagoromo's elder son, Indra, to go in war with his younger brother. It
                                decided that Indra's descendants, the Uchiha, would be the main cast of the shinobi
                                history it was creating and also modified Hagoromo's
                                tablet to claim that among other things; the Infinite Tsukuyomi would be the Uchiha's
                                salvation.
