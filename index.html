                            <p>Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her
                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra
                                and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point
                                where she can break through boulders with

                                that most others would consider impossible.
                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her
                                forehead to Creation Rebirth, a technique that
                                releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the cells in her body to heal any wound.
                                It gives her a "immortality" in battle that
                                even Orochimaru envied. However, because of the rapid cell regeneration, the
                                technique shortens her life similar to the Four-Tailed
                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the
                                technique, Tsunade has made the choice to only use
                                Creation Rebirth in extremely desperate situations.</p>                       </div>

                            <p class="card-text">Konan (Â∞èÂçó, Konan) was a kunoichi from Amegakure and a founding member
                                of the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death, she was partnered with Nagato, who had
                                since taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only member to call him
                                by his name. After Nagato's death, Konan defected from Akatsuki and became the de facto
                                village head of Amegakure.

                            <p>When she was young, Konan's family was killed during the Second Shinobi World War, and
                                she was left to fend for herself.[4] Some time later, Yahiko found her, and the two
                                worked together to survive. Not long after that, Konan
                                went for a walk and found a young, dying Nagato and his dog, Chibi. She rescued him and
                                brought him back to their hideout. Gradually the three became best friends. They
                                eventually encountered the Sannin, who gave them some
                                food. Konan impressed them by making an elaborate flower out of the paper wrappers left
                                behind as a sign of gratitude. When Orochimaru suggested to kill them so they would not
                                have to suffer the horrors of war, Jiraiya
                                instead opted to stay and teach the three how to look after themselves.</p>                       </div>

                            <p>Ebisu is portrayed as a stern and "by-the-book" type of person. Initially, he expressed
                                hatred for Naruto Uzumaki, and believed he was nothing but a worthless nuisance and
                                mocked his dream of becoming Hokage as he believes
                                that only people of high lineage could amount to anything. Upon seeing what Naruto had
                                done for Konohamaru his perspective changed drastically, and later the village during
                                Pain's assault on it, he chose not to surrender
                                Naruto's location and would rather be killed. He is also rather attached to his pupils,
                                and has shown immense pride in them, such as when Konohamaru performed the Rasengan on
                                Pain while rescuing Ebisu.

						<p> He is one of the three legendary sannin and at the time of the series is between the ages of 51-54.  
							Jiraiya started out as a pupil of the Third Hokage, along with teammates Orochimaru and Tsunade.  
							Some time after he and the other two left the Third's instruction they found themselves in a battle with Hanzo of the Rain village.  So impressed was Hanzo, with their abilities that he dubbed them the three sannin, or most powerful shinobi of the leaf village, and ended the current war. 
							After that Jiraiya encountered the Toad sages in his wandering, and found his natural affinity for the sage chakra.  After returning to the village, Jiraiya reached Jonin level and became the instructor of Minato Namikaze, who would later become the Fourth Hokage and Naruto's father.  
							Years later Orochimaru defected from the village and Jiraiya went in pursuit of him to bring him back (very much mirroring Naruto's work to bring Sasuke back).  However, unlike Naruto, Jiraiya decided that he could do nothing to save Orochimaru, and instead left the village in order to keep an eye on Orochimaru's plans.  
							This meant he was unable to take the role of Hokage as the third had hoped, and the role fell to Minato.
