Unlike her mother, Izumi's father was not an Uchiha.During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, her father died while protecting her.From the grief brought on by his death, as well as feelings of guilt that he would not have died had Izumi been stronger,Izumi eventually awakened her Sharingan. She and her mother afterwards rejoined the Uchiha clan.</p>
                <p>Izumi enrolled in Konoha's Academy a few years later.Like other girls her age, Izumi developed a crush on Itachi Uchiha, a boy in the class next to hers.As such, she tried to talk with him during school breaks, walk home with him after lessons, and defend him from their peers' criticism. Itachi initially took the same disinterest in Izumi that he had in all the other girls until discovering that she had the Sharingan, which he himself had yet to awaken.He afterwards became warmer to her whenever their paths crossed. </p>

                                    <p>She would further speed up the process by giving her targets a choice between a French or traditional kiss. Her most preferable victims were those with a natural affinity for wind chakra. She took great pride in her appearance and would become infuriated when any harm came to her physical being, especially her hair, the very casing of her soul. During her second fight against Naruto Uzumaki, she showcased a sadistic side when she delighted in Naruto's anguish. She has shown an intelligent side as seen when she thought that Sora and Naruto were connected somehow.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Tsunade is a kunoichi from the Hidden Leaf Village and posses
                                Monstrous physical
                                strength, extremely advanced healing and regenerative techniques, physician/surgeon
                                level of knowledge
                                of the human body and great Chakra control. At once formed part of "The Legendary
                                Sannin" along with
                                Jiraiya and Orochimaru, and under the tutelage of the Third Hokage. Currently, she
                                has become the Fifth
                                Hokage of The Hidden Leaf Village. Her grandparents are revealed to be Hashirama
                                Senju and Mito Uzumaki.</p>
                            <p>Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her
                                excellent chakra control. By storing chakra
                                and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point
                                where she can break through boulders with
                                her bare hands. She is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds
                                that most others would consider impossible.
                                She went as far as to use the Shadow Seal: Release to store her chakra in her
                                forehead to Creation Rebirth, a technique that
                                releases the chakra to rapidly regenerate the cells in her body to heal any wound.
                                It gives her a "immortality" in battle that
                                even Orochimaru envied. However, because of the rapid cell regeneration, the
                                technique shortens her life similar to the Four-Tailed
                                transformation, however more controlled. Because of the risk associated with the
                                technique, Tsunade has made the choice to only use
                                Creation Rebirth in extremely desperate situations.</p>

                        found crying in a place near her village by the young Kakashi, who spotted her and carried her
                        on his back. He then explained to her that she can look up to the clouds above and find her way.
                        They both were then seen by a ninja from Hanare's village and Kakashi put her down on her feet,
                        said goodbye and left. She was then excited that someone like Kakashi was able to help her in
                        her life.

                        At one point, she met Kakashi Hatake and developed romantic feelings for him. Hanare, a spy from

During one of these attacks, he fought the Eight-Tails alone, allowing his comrades to escape. Their battle resulted in him receiving a self-inflicted wound to the chest after he collapsed upon his own hand, which became his life's shame.</p>
                            <p>Since this event, he made it a personal duty to combat the Eight-Tails whenever its jinchūriki lost control, eventually making even his son become part of the group that supported him during these occurrences.

                                they (like many other of the girls) started plotting to date him. Up until that point Ino was very encouraging to Sakura trying to break her out of her shell, but after that point focusing on sabotaging her. They both were
                                quick to insult each other and belittle the abilities of the other. This conflict didn't come to outright blows however. At least not until the Chunin tournament.</p>

                                her personality. In the beginning Ino was something of the Queen Bee in the School, very popular, pretty, and charismatic. She and Sakura were good friends right up until the time they started noticing Sasuke, and than
                                they (like many other of the girls) started plotting to date him. Up until that point Ino was very encouraging to Sakura trying to break her out of her shell, but after that point focusing on sabotaging her. They both were
                                quick to insult each other and belittle the abilities of the other. This conflict didn't come to outright blows however. At least not until the Chunin tournament.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Iruka Umino is a character we see once every year. Originally, he’s the only adult we first meet that cared for Naruto, while everyone else in the village despised him. </p>
                            <p>The entire first chapter of Naruto focuses on Iruka and Naruto’s character arc, as he is the only person who bonds with Naruto on the first few chapters. Afterward, Iruka is shelved, and we only see him once every year, as
                                he occasionally pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>
                            <p>We meet stronger ninjas with different jutsus later on in the series, who basically make us forget all about Iruka, aside from the one time he shines as Naruto’s godfather. He’s really only still around for nostalgic reasons--
                                as both readers and Naruto grow up with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than Iruka (i.e.,
                                Jiraiya, Kakashi).

                                given to him for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi. Though largely successful in this regard, Sai retained an interest in art. When Shin, an older Root member, discovered Sai's drawing ability, he encouraged Sai's talent
                                and they became very close.

                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the
                                final against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of
                                chakra and he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort
                                to slow Sasuke down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.

                                he occasionally pops up as the moral support. As a ninja, however, he’s pretty useless.</p>

                                as both readers and Naruto grow up with other characters-- and he doesn’t add too much to the plot. Naruto goes on to meet other mentors and figures that have a much more significant impression on him than Iruka (i.e.,

                            <p>We first see Temari entering the Leaf village with Kankuro and Gaara, her 2 siblings. In the first round of the preliminaries of the final chunin exam Temari fights against Ten-Ten who she easily defeats and continues to the final
                            against Shikamaru. In this fight Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow possession, she manages to outrun this for a while but in the end Shikamaru's great mind outwits her, however Shikamaru runs out of chakra and
                            he gives up, this leaves Temari as the winner. When the invasion of Konoha begins, Temari is forced to help Gaara flee the village. In the anime, when Sasuke begins to pursue them, Temari stays behind in an effort to slow Sasuke
                            down, though he defeats her with little effort. After Gaara is defeated, Temari and Kankuro carry him home.</p>

                            knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in "exterminating" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have
                            somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely

A Kirigakure ninja, Gengo allied with Zabuza Momochi in a coup attempt against the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura. After the coup failed, Gengo overthrew the ruler of the Land of Silence and used the Fourth Great Shinobi War to build his power, using his genjutsu to capture high level ninja. Considered one of the greatest genjutsu users to ever live, his specialty is sound-based genjutsu.

                            Miroku also gave Shion a bell as a protective charm, which, unknown to Shion at the time, was imbued with tremendous powers to protect her when necessary. Shion ultimately saw her mother die when she sealed Mōryō away. Shion
                            herself was then tasked to train in the method to seal away Mōryō again should the situation arise. </p>

                            on sight. Gaara would try to assure them he meant no harm, but in the process would inadvertently injure or even kill them with his sand. Gaara did not understand this pain he caused others because his sand protected him from
                            all injury. When he was six years old, Gaara asked Yashamaru to explain pain to him.</p>

                            praised highly for his clay sculptures, Deidara's desire to reach even greater heights in his art resulted with him stealing one of his village's kinjutsu that allows one to knead their chakra into substances.[1] Using explosive
                            clay to take out his pursuers, Deidara found the art he had desired: the Art of a Single Moment (一瞬の芸術, Isshun no Geijutsu).[1] Remembering the first moment whenever he detonated his explosive clay, he recalls the process that
                            allowed him to reach this art. Since then, Deidara became a missing-nin and offered his services as a bomber to insurgents in various countries.[1]

Through having his nutrients absorbed from within his body, Isshiki began gaining control over Jigen's body, and eventually Jigen lost full control of it. Afterwards, Isshiki embedded his Kāma in Jigen, but because Jigen's body wasn't powerful enough to sustain him, Isshiki opted not to revive himself in Jigen, instead waiting until a more suitable vessel could be found.</p>
                        <p>As the leader of Kara, Jigen's body is modified with Scientific Ninja Tools, and is a complete monster in terms of power and ability. The strongest of his organisation, his might far surpasses even the other Inners. As the current vessel of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki, all his power comes from the exceedingly powerful Celestial Being who resides within his body</p>

Only Kawaki survived to become an actual vessel. Code on the other hand underwent shaking and spasms like the unsuccessful deceased candidates but managed to survive. Upon which, his branded mark become a White Kāma. Sometime after the Ōtsutsuki ritual, already deeply loyal to Isshiki, Code was so jealous to see only Kawaki proved viable as his next vessel that he came to openly hate Kawaki and even made it clear that if he weren't the vessel he would kill him with his own hands. Meanwhile, with the astounding reaction that took place in Code's body, his combat abilities exceeded Jigen's. While anyone in Kara who became stronger than Jigen through modifications would normally be disposed of to avoid undermining his position of leader, Code was exempted due to his unwavering loyalty, leading to Amado to instead install limiters in his body that only the scientist could deactivate</p>

                            Beast" (Konoha no Kedakai Aoi Mōjū; aka. "Konoha's Noble Green Beast"). Guy's favorite foods are super-spicy curry rice and curry udon, though he finds it impossible to dislike food. His favorite phrase is "Bursting with youth!"</p>
                        <p>Guy is on good terms with all of his students, though seems to have a particular interest in Lee, who reminds Guy of himself when he was younger, in that they were both considered to be losers and have had to earn everything through
                            hard work. As such, Guy puts much more interest in Lee's training than Neji's or Tenten's, continuing to train Lee long after the others have given up for the day. Because of this, and due to Lee's unyielding desire to master
                            the art of taijutsu, Guy has taught Lee a number of dangerous and forbidden techniques, giving the stipulation that Lee can only use them under specific circumstances. Although Guy knows of the dangers that teaching the techniques
                            to Lee entails, Guy wishes for Lee to be able to prove himself to be a splendid ninja, and as such turns a blind eye to the repercussions.</p>

While being raised by his Anbu parents,[7] Konohamaru was never referred to by his name by the villagers, only ever called "Honourable Grandson" (お孫様, Omago-sama) because of his relationship to the Hokage.</p>

            Jugo (重吾, Jūgo) is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.[ch. 414] After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation.[ch. 414] Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz and is also voiced by Kyle Hebert in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.

                    <p>Fukasaku and Shima both seem fond of Naruto. Fukasaku met Naruto for the first time when he brought the news of Jiraiya's death to Konoha. He found Naruto's nickname for Jiraiya ("Pervy Sage") to be both very fitting and very funny, but observed that Naruto, as he was, would not stand a chance against Pain, and offered to take Naruto away to learn senjutsu at Mount Myōboku. After what was (for Naruto) a confusing introduction to sensing natural energy and drawing it in to blend senjutsu chakra, Fukasaku, in light of Naruto's rapid progress, believed that Naruto would surpass Jiraiya in power.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Butsuma Senju (千手仏間, Senju Butsuma) was a member of the Senju clan during the war-torn era preceding the era of hidden villages.</p>
                  <p> Butsuma appeared to be a stoic and calm man but was also quite stern and somewhat belligerent. He lost his temper and even went as far as to hit his son Hashirama when the latter brought up the subject of using innocent children as shinobi, believing that they had died true shinobi and would not stand for his son besmirching that memory. He believed that raising your children to be the best shinobi they can was the greatest love a parent could show for their child. He and Tajima, were also very alike as a result of their continuous battles, both in skill, and mindset, which was why they presumably ended in stalemate with every confrontation. They even shared no hesitation in killing each other's respective offspring just to create an opening to attack each other. Despite the time he lived in making him seem like a harsh parent, he nonetheless did love his sons dearly. After learning Hashirama often went out to hang out with a member of the Uchiha Clan, he kept it a secret from the rest of the clan to prevent Hashirama from being branded a traitor. He was also angry when Hashirama did what he perceived as "disrespecting" Kawarama and punched him, but when Tobirama pointed out Hashirama was depressed, he stopped from attacking Hashirama any further, telling him to cool off.</p>

He didn't care what the rest of the village thought of Naruto; Naruto loved ramen and Ichiraku loved preparing it for him. Since ramen has been the extent of their relationship all these years, Ichiraku was surprised to be invited to Naruto's wedding.</p>
                      <p> He decides that giving Naruto free ramen for a year would be the most appropriate wedding gift. Ichiraku then realises how much ramen Naruto can eat, and starts decreasing the duration of the offer, but every span of time he considers leaves him with visions of Ichiraku Ramen going bankrupt and his daughter being put out on the street. He also has visions of Naruto's smiling face whenever he finishes a bowl of his ramen. Ichiraku settles on giving Naruto free and unlimited ramen for the rest of his life.</p>

Kakashi has clashed with the likes of Zabuza and Obito, Guy nearly defeated Madara by opening all Eight Gates, and Asuma had one of the saddest deaths as a result of his intense battle with Hidan. The only jonin teacher who failed to have at least one memorable battle is Kurenai.
                            
                            Even in her brief encounter with Itachi, Kurenai's most redeeming factor, her genjutsu, proved to be useless against the Uchiha's Mangekyo Sharingan. Even since that one underwhelming exchange, Kurenai became pregnant and disappeared from the battlefield for the rest of the series.</p>

While A flatly told his men to reject Tsunade's offer, Darui informed A that he already informed Killer B of this.

                          <p>Using cloning technology, Mitsuki was created as a clone of Orochimaru, being cultivated from the same embryo as at least one older "Mitsuki", and raised in a test tube. Just like his "brother", Mitsuki was named after "Tsuki" (坏 , literally meaning: Shallow bowl) and the sixth sign of the Chinese zodiac calendar, "Mi" (巳, literally meaning: Snake). In the event someone was to learn what Mitsuki was, Orochimaru implanted a strong juinjutsu on his heart,that would automatically activate, causing Mitsuki to self destruct in order to conceal the secrets of Orochimaru's research.

During Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Darui goes to the Leaf Village to oversee the Chunnin Exams. He is voiced by Ryota Takeuchi in the Japanese anime and Catero Colbert in the English dub, though Ogie Banks replaces the latter for the Ultimate Ninja Storm series of video games.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Kawaki (カワキ, Kawaki) is a tattooed youth who became a member of Kara after being brought by Jigen from a drunkard father, bearing a tattoo of the Roman numeral IX under his left eye and bestowed a Kama mark by Jigen to be made into a living weapon for Kara. He was heavily modified with microscopic Shinobi-Ware implanted in his body that give him abilities similar to Jugo's Sage Transformation in altering his physiology at a cellular level. For reasons yet to be revealed, Kawaki left Kara and encountered Boruto who brings him to the Hidden Leaf as he lives with the Uzumaki family. The two would end up becoming enemies as hinted in prologue of the Boruto series, an older Kawaki appearing to have perpetrated Konoha's destruction as he confronts an older Boruto while declaring the age of shinobi has come to an end.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Konan (小南) is the only female ninja in Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being a partner of Nagato, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Nagato, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as "God's angel". While under Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and leaves the organization. Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes. She fights him, but is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's resting place. In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka and in the English anime, her voice actress is Dorothy Elias-Fahn.</p>

                    first born son of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. He was initially thought
                    to be the most suitable successor of his father's teachings,
                    however, it was his younger brother Asura that ended up
                    inheriting this mantle — a decision that would lead the two
                    brothers to fight against each other. Indra is also credited
                    with being the creator of ninjutsu, and the progenitor of the
                    Uchiha clan.</p>
                    <p>Indra's invention of ninjutsu would later become prominently
                    recognised for jump-starting the age of the shinobi in
                    history, though many credited Hagoromo as its creator rather
                    than Indra himself; a fact that became forgotten to time.
                    Though his body was destroyed, Indra's chakra would continue
                    to exist.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Chojuro (長十郎, Chōjūrō) is one of Mei Terumi's bodyguards, with the other being Ao. He is one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, carrying the sword Hiramekarei (ヒラメカレイ), but after Zabuza Momochi and Kisame Hoshigaki are killed, he becomes the only real one left of the Swordsmen; in addition, he is the only one affiliated with the village at the beginning of the series. Chojuro frequently annoys Ao because he stutters and seems to lack self-confidence. After accompanying the Mizukage to the Kage Summit, he helps her guard the daimyō of the Shinobi Countries, and is able to gain enough self-confidence to help Naruto defeat Black Zetsu. He later becomes the Sixth Mizukage (六代目水影, Rokudaime Mizukage) sometime after the war. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Kouki Miyata, while Brian Beacock provides his voice in the English adaptation.</p>
                      <p>Despite his membership in the elite Seven Swordsmen group, Chōjūrō is a shy individual and seems to lack confidence in his abilities. He also greatly respects and admires the Fifth Mizukage, as he commented inwardly on wanting to protect her "beautiful smile". By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Mei has noted that he has become a lot more confident in himself as seen when he cut down Black Zetsu without reservation and then declares to the Fifth that as a member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he would guard the area with his life. Years later after becoming the Sixth Mizukage, Chōjūrō has seemed to grow well into his new role, appearing much calmer and confident in his abilities.</p>

                    Might Duy (マイト・ダイ, Maito Dai), often referred to as the Eternal
                    Genin (万年下忍, Mannen Genin), was a shinobi of Konohagakure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Duy was a proud and upbeat man. Like his son, he was overzealous,
                    regularly using a "nice guy" pose, thanking people who were otherwise
                    chiding him for his behaviour, or low rank. He believed strongly that
                    one must have confidence in themselves in order to achieve anything.
                    He also believed that one's true youth only ends when one turns their back
                    on their beliefs and joy. Duy had a very strong relationship to his son,
                    constantly pushing Guy to be his best and lifting his spirits when upset; a
                    relationship that is parallel to Guy and his disciple, Rock Lee. A committed
                    man, he had no fear in facing his enemies, nor in sacrificing his life for Guy's
                    sake. Duy would pass on to Guy the belief that the truest expression of strength
                    was not defeating a powerful opponent, but defending the ones he loved.

                                <p>After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side.[ch. 482] Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time.She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she moved on from Sasuke due to wanting him to be happy and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing Naruto's chakra as "bright and warm".</p>
                                <p>Karin has been praised for her abilities by both Obito Uchiha and Orochimaru, the latter deciding to take her with him for that reason. Despite being mostly a non-combatant, Orochimaru referred to Karin as one of his good experiments,[4] and had enough faith in her skills to put her in charge of the Southern Hideout's prison, since she made escaping impossible. Karin later demonstrated these skills most predominantly during the Fourth Shinobi World War, where she destroyed much of Tobi's giant wooden statue.</p>

                                awakened this power, he has always used it simultaneously with the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. Directly after obtaining
                                Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's power, Naruto's eyes are yellow and later orange with the various chakra modes he uses after the
                                war, just like his previous ones before meeting Hagoromo. This mode increases the user's physical parameters well
                                above that of Sage Mode and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.</p>

                                further, such as being able to levitate, becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard and durable

In Japanese, Pakkun uses "washi" (ワシ) when referring to himself, which is generally used by older men. Despite his lazy demeanour, Pakkun is shown to be fiercely proud and determined ninken. When offered by Sai to deliver a message with one of his ink creatures, Pakkun insisted that he deliver it, not wanting to look inferior.

To help hold off the growing curse in her from erasing her memories, she was given a special hair-clip inherited from her ancestor Kuen. By age twenty, due to the curse, a mark appeared on her left palm, putting her at risk of gradually losing memories. Ultimately, she was betrothed to Kankitsu to subdue the curse for another hundred years. Soon afterwards, Remon became troubled at how cold Kankitsu suddenly became.</p>
          <p>Remon has fair skin, orange eyes with black pupils, blonde long wavy hair tied in a bun and is secured by a golden clip, and a beauty mark on the left side of her chin.

On a monitor, Shikamaru Nara explained that everyone only needs to answer one question on the test, but their team's combined score must equal exactly 100 points to pass. While everyone was struggling to find a way to contact their team members, 
            Yukata couldn't even solve the written problems themselves. After time is up, Shikamaru revealed a bonus question. She, like her teammates, left the question unanswered, and ultimately her team passed the first round. However, a preliminary round had to be held to lessen the many participants there were which involved a race to Suna where only the first 30 teams to arrive at the destination would qualify for the second phase.
          Yukata is a fair-skinned girl with long, dark hair and large, brown eyes framed by noticeable eyelashes. She wears the standard attire of the Sunagakure shinobi with a flak jacket, a dark skirt, two arm-guards and the forehead protector of the Allied Shinobi Forces. During the Chūnin Exams, she wore a grey midriff vest over a short plain shirt, revealing her bare stomach. She already wore her arm-guards and the skirt.

Ultimately, the only attack strong enough to seriously injure him was his own, resulting in the scar on his chest.</p>

                      <p>Years after infusing himself with Hashirama's DNA and unknowingly mixing Indra's and Asura's chakra, Madara's Sharingan evolved into the Rinnegan. As the eyes' original owner, only he could use them to their maximum power. He was able to switch between both dōjutsu. With the Rinnegan, Madara could use all of the abilities of the Six Paths Technique, such as the Preta Path to absorb chakra and the Deva Path to perform Chibaku Tensei. He could also use the Outer Path to create chakra chains that could restrain all nine tailed beasts and black receivers for various melee and supplementary purposes. Through the usage of his Rinnegan with that of his Sharingan, Madara could summon meteorites to cause widespread destruction.</p>

Despite the seal's strength, it almost broke when she was going through childbirth. Towards the final years of her life, it was decided that a new host for Kurama would have to be found. 
                        Kushina Uzumaki, one of Mito's clansmen, was then selected for the role due to her special chakra.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Metal Lee bears a strong resemblance to his father: he has shiny black hair worn in a bowl-cut style, dark eyes, and very thick eyebrows. His eyes, however, are noticeably sharper. His likeness is further perpetuated by his attire: he wears a green jumpsuit with orange leg warmers, a scarf and bandages over his hands. </p>
                        <p>Metal is a very respectful and honourable young man who tends to talk exclusively without contractions in his words. He apparently gained this nature from his father, Rock Lee, whom he has sincere respect for, and likewise his father's sensei, Might Guy. Also like his father, he is a hot-blooded and dedicated shinobi, exemplified from consistently participating in his father's daily gruesome training regime. At the same time however, he has stage fright, as when too many people watch him, he locks up and becomes unable to move or perform properly
			     Metal specialises in the Strong Fist-style taijutsu, and, when not overwhelmed by his insecurities, lives up to his reputation as a genius even within his taijutsu-excelling clan.</p>
